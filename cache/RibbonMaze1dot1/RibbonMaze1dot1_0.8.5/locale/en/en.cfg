[mod-setting-description]
ribbon-maze-blocks=Sets the maze width matching the block size (ignored if map gen settings are finite)
ribbon-maze-chart-nearby-crude-oil=Immediately reveal one crude oil patch near the start (crude oil must be controlled by Ribbon Maze to have an effect)
ribbon-maze-chart-nearby-uranium-ore=Immediately reveal one uranium ore patch near the start (uranium ore must be controlled by Ribbon Maze to have an effect)
ribbon-maze-clear-start=Clear out a square area of the maze for a number of start chunks (32 tiles per chunk). Makes more room for starter base and spawning and creates more entry points into maze.
ribbon-maze-coal=Does Ribbon Maze control coal generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-copper-ore=Does Ribbon Maze control copper ore generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-crude-oil=Does Ribbon Maze control crude oil generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-iron-ore=Does Ribbon Maze control iron ore generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-stone=Does Ribbon Maze control stone generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-uranium-ore=Does Ribbon Maze control uranium ore generation by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-mod-resources=Does Ribbon Maze control non-vanilla resources by placing rich patches, at dead-ends only?
ribbon-maze-mixed-patchwork-min=Mixed ores are a patchwork, the minimum size of each little patch is controlled by this setting.
ribbon-maze-mixed-patchwork-max=Mixed ores are a patchwork, the maximum size of each little patch is controlled by this setting.
ribbon-maze-mixed-preferred=Resources mixed near the start, are mixed throughout the maze.
ribbon-maze-separate-out-infinite-ores=Infinite ores (from mods e.g. Angel's Infinite Ores) are put in their own patches rather than in the middle of normal patches
ribbon-maze-infinite-ore-stretch-factor=How many chunks between increases in the size of infinite ore patches (from mods e.g. Angel's Infinite Ores). Higher values mean you have to travel further to get bigger infinite ore patches.
ribbon-maze-resource-stretch-factor=Stretches out the increase in resource richness. Higher values mean you have to travel further to get richer resources.
ribbon-maze-block-size=The size of the paths and "walls" of the maze in tiles.
ribbon-maze-loop-chance=Gives a chance of loops in the maze (making the maze imperfect). Note that more loops mean fewer dead-ends, reducing the number of resource patches.
ribbon-maze-water-resource=Makes water eligible to be placed at dead ends. This will compete with resources, but make it easier to access more water without terraforming
ribbon-maze-clearing-chance=Chance of large clearings appearing in the maze
ribbon-maze-clearing-size-max=Largest allowed size of random clearings in the maze
ribbon-maze-mangrove-density=Spawn chance of mangroves
ribbon-maze-green-raw-ratio=The ratio of green to raw wood produced by mangroves. Green wood can be "smelted" into raw wood, once you unlock wood kiln drying.
