[mod-setting-description]
range-multiplier=Multiplies both construction/logistics default or previously-modded ranges by this factor.\nUse 1 for no changes, >1 to increase, or e.g. 0.5 to reduce it. Result will be rounded to nearest integer value.\nApplied before range values below.
range-logistics=Logistics bot range (radius) of the roboport.\nDefault/vanilla is 25 (displayed as 50x50 on roboport).\nSpecial values: -1 - do not change it via this option, -2 - set to be equal to construction range.\nApplied after multiplier above and after static construction range value (if set).
range-construction=Construction bot range (radius) of the roboport.\nDefault/vanilla is 55 (displayed as 110x110 on roboport).\nSpecial values: -1 - do not change it via this option, -2 - set to be equal to logistics range.\nApplied after multiplier above and after static logistics range value (if set).
range-min-to-affect=Minimum range (radius) value to affect it by range options above.\nUse this to avoid affecting roboports that are "recharge stations" and such, that have no or tiny robot range and are not supposed to have it.\nConstruction/logistic ranges on same roboport are checked and tweaked separately.
robot-energy-multiplier=Max energy value (battery capacity) multiplier for construction and logistic robots. Values >1 will allow these bots to fly longer without running out of power.
affect-mod-entities=If enabled (default), mod will affect all roboports/robots in their respective categories, including those added by mods, and only ones from base game otherwise.
