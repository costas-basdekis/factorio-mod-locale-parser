[technology-description]
crew-ship=To reach other planets it's necessary to enter and travel with the rocket. The crew capsule has enough space to take you to every known place in the universe.
cargo-ship=Without interplanetary trading our extensions doesn't make much sense. The cargo ship lets us sends goods to other planets.
moon-rocket-silo=A new Rocket Silo is needed to reach the Moon.
moon-plastic-bar=There is no coal on the Moon. We need to find another way to create plastic there.
moon-regolith-processing=There is so much regolith on the Moon. There needs to be a way to have a better use for this resource.
ice-melting=Without water we need to melt the Ice we find to get it.
helium3-liquefaction=No oil means no oil processing. Luckily we find a way to liquify the Helium3.
