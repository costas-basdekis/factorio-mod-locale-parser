Ingots used in place of plates for metals without plates. Presently all tiles are functionally identical and includes two metals from Madclowns Processing if you've that installed as well.\n \n Base tile used from Yuoki Railways, tweaked for each metal. \n \n Fair warning, this mod consumes 25-27 tiles, so you might start hitting limits if bundled with mods like Alien Biomes.
