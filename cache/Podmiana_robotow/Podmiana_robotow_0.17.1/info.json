Bots in the replacer provider chest are released to the network when a bot of the same type, but different name is found in a roboport.  The bots that do not match the provider are removed from the roboport and placed in the logistics storage network.  Should work with all modded bots and roboports (Tested with Bob's and Yuoki's)."}
