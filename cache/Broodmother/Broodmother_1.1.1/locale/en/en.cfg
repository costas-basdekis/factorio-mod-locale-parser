[technology-description]
spider-mother=The Broodmother is unlocked, a spidertron that primarily attacks by spawning baby spidertrons follow their mother and auto attack for it. The babies get the same ammo loadout and equipment grid modules as their mother when spawned. For ammo that means type and count of each ammo slot will be the same as their mother, but it will be filled from her trunk on spawn if the mother's auto attack options are off. Equipment is cloned on birth from the mother for free, but nothing in a baby spider's grid can be taken out. If a baby spider is too far from their mother or out of attacking options they despawn immediately. The broodmother uses some health to spawn a baby spider but also regenerates health over time.
