train-overhaul-nuclear-loco-explosion=Nuclear locomotive explosion
train-overhaul-weight-multiplicator=Train weight multiplicator
train-overhaul-power-multiplicator=Locomotive power multiplicator
train-overhaul-old-sounds=classic train sounds
train-overhaul-hand-crafting=allow hand crafting

[mod-setting-description]
train-overhaul-nuclear-loco-explosion=True: (default)\nDestroying a nuclear locomotive triggers a nuclear explosion.
train-overhaul-weight-multiplicator=Higher weight will reduce acceleration and increase breaking distances.
train-overhaul-old-sounds=Use pre 0.18 sounds for locomotive engine, wheel noises and drive over tie.
train-overhaul-power-multiplicator=More power increases acceleration and fuel consumption, top speed is not affected.
