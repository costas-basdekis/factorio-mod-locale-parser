[mod-setting-description]
resistance_coefficient=(default 18) area * coeficient. (coef of train is 1.8, sports car 0.3, old car 0.8, cube 2.1) 1.8 * ~10m^2 area = 18
friction_coefficient=(default 0.001) steel wheel on steel rail has 0.001-0.002 , car on asphalt can have 0.01, car on sand can even reach 0.3 . This value is actually modified in code, because friction force should be just weight*velocity*this, but then more weight you apply, than smaller it gets, so it gets hairy...
traction_coefficient=(default 0.3) for reference tyre on asphalt have 1.0, sports car tyre on asphalt have 1.5, steel wheel on rail has 0.3, on wet day asphalt-tyre can go to 0.3 and rail lubricated with leaves might have 0.05 or worse. This is actually equal to number of G's breaking or accelerating can add at most.
slip_transfer_modifier=If your locomotive acceleration force is greater, then it's traction, then if this is set to: \n0.0 - it will only apply "max traction force". Rest will be lost to slipping wheels.\n1.0 - all force will be transfered to train and you will practically ignore traction (beware, trains at low speeds have HUUUUUGE torque, so if you set it to 1.0, don't be surprised to see train with 40 wagons reaching 30kmph within 1 second...).\n You can also set it to anywhere between, for example 0.2 will cause slipping train to use 20% of excessive force + 80% of max traction force.
particles=If force applied on wheels is greater than force with which train is normally breaking, there are particles showing that wheels are slipping. It can be disabled, because all trains create a lot of particles, because of their huge torque when they just start and particles cost quite some computation time (in my testing world drifting with train doubled script time usage).
debug spamming=if train has player it prints all information about current state of train, all forces applied to it.
debug frequency=each [debug frequency]'th game-tick debug message (described 1 line above) will be printed.
