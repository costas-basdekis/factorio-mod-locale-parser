{"name": "Truce-Mod", "version": "1.0.2", "title": "Truce Mod", "author": "Jimbopim", "description": "This mod makes the enemy initially friendly to you. The enemy will only attack when the timer has reached zero (or optionally, if you get too close/attack them). \nHowever, enemies will still be affected by and evolve from pollution.\n\nThis mod is great for players who wants to play on hard difficulty level with time to prepare themselves before getting attacked. Or simply, for someone who wants a challenge and see if they have the required skills to build a defense quick enough before the time runs out and the enemy destroys them.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["base >= 1.1"]}
