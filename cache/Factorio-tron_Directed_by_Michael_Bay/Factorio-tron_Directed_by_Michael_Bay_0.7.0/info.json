I love this game. The camera-work is superb, and the acting from the protagonist is better than I've ever gotten out of my actors. But there's one thing missing and I just had to add it to take this game from an indie production to a Hollywood blockbuster. EXPLOSIONS BABY! With the help of this mod, when anything in the game gets destroyed, it now leaves this world with a random, earth shattering explosion - Just like real life! Chests? Inserters? Trees? Anything from other mods? KABOOM!!", "factorio_version": "0.17"}
