[mod-setting-name]
bet-cheatsy-braking=Braking force/power multiplier
bet-cheatsy-locs=Enable cheatsy locomotive settings
bet-cheatsy-power=Locomotive acceleration power
bet-cheatsy-speed=Top speed
bet-cheatsy-wagons=Enable cheatsy wagon settings
bet-equipment-gridtype=Equipment grid for locomotives
bet-recycling=Battery pack recycling
bet-return-partial-batteries=Return partially discharged battery packs

[mod-setting-description]
bet-cheatsy-braking=Increase (or decrease) braking force and braking power of wagons and battery-electric locomotives (if enabled) by multiplying with this factor. 1 = no change. [0.1 – 100000]
bet-cheatsy-locs=Set the top speed and acceleration power of battery-electric locomotives.
bet-cheatsy-power=Acceleration power of battery-electric locomotives (if enabled). [100 – 100000 kW]
bet-cheatsy-speed=Top speed of wagons and battery-electric locomotives (if enabled). [10 – 7386.3 km/h]
bet-cheatsy-wagons=Increase the top speed of all cargo, fluid and artillery wagons to match the locomotive.
bet-equipment-gridtype=Choose which type of equipment grid from other mods to use for battery-electric locomotives.
bet-recycling=About 90 % of real battery packs can be recycled, so add some researchable battery pack recycling recipes. May cause compatibility issues with other recycling mods.
bet-return-partial-batteries=Return a discharged battery pack when mining or deconstructing a battery-electric locomotive with a partially discharged battery pack inside, instead of losing it. Can be disabled to save some precious UPS.
