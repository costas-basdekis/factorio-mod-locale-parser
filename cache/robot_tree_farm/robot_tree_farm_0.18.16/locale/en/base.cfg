[item-description]
rtf-landfill=Lets you transform any area into acreage
rtf-water-gun-ammo=Fill this into your flamethrower and transform deserts into green farmland.\nYou can extinguish fires with this.

terraforming2=Farmlandfill


[technology-description]
terraforming=Gives you the ability to transform deserts into green farmland

rtf-levels=Levels of Tree Growth
rtf-terraforming=Terraforming
rtf-small-crops=Small crops
rtf-only-harvest-robot-placed=Only harvest robot-placed crops
rtf-auto-trash-seeds=Automatically send seeds to the logistic network
rtf-seeds-per-tree=Seeds per tree
rtf-uniseed=Universal Seed
rtf-growth-speed=Growth speed
rtf-touch-enemy-evo-factor=Touch evolution factor
rtf-extra-pollution-absorbtion=Extra pollution absorbtion

[mod-setting-description]
rtf-levels=This can increase your game's loading time.\nIncreases the amount of steps between seedling and grown up tree.\nMin: 3\nDefault: 20\nMax: 200\nSetting this to 200 instead of 20 will consume 900 MB of RAM and increase the UPS load by ~ 0.120 per roboport (which is not much)
rtf-terraforming=Choose if and how you have to create farmland for your trees
rtf-small-crops=Reduces the crop size to 1x1 instead of 2x2
rtf-only-harvest-robot-placed=Manually planted crops won't get harvested automatically\n(So you can make your own permanent forests)
rtf-auto-trash-seeds=When you pick up a seed, a trash filter is automatically set to send it to the logistic network
rtf-seeds-per-tree=The amount of seeds you get per tree, can be decimal (min: 1)
rtf-uniseed=This will make all trees drop the same seed and planted trees will be randomized depending on what wild trees you have mined
rtf-growth-speed=This is a multiplier for how fast the trees grow.\nBy default, the trees will be harvested after 2 days.\nHigher multipliers decrease performance, especially with a high level count\nMin: 0.1 (very slow)
rtf-touch-enemy-evo-factor=Since absorbed pollution has no effect on the enemy evolution factor, the script needs to manually reduce the evolution factor. When a tree has grown up the enemy evolution factor gets reduced by (1-evo) * 0.0000035 * ThisSettingsValue
rtf-extra-pollution-absorbtion=This is the additional pollution each tree absorbs until it's grown up, additional to its vanilla tree-absorbtion.
