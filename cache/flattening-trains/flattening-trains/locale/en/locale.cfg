[mod-setting-description]
flattening-trains-power-efficiency-multiplier=2 -> 50% of fuel consumption/200% efficiency, 4 -> 25% of fuel consumption/400% efficiency etc. The bigger this number is, the longer fuel lasts in locomotives for same rolling power generated. If you want to preserve original fuel consumption, set this settings to whatever you have `Trains power multiplier` set.

flattening-trains-fuel-slot-amount-multiplier=Multiplies slot amount (both input and output) by this real value. Will not reduce fuel slot amount below 1. Rounds values to integer using standard math rules (rounding down if fraction is below 0.5)
flattening-trains-fuel-slot-amount-flat=Will not reduce fuel slot amount below 1 if negative. If burner output slots are zero, they are unaffected. The value is added on top of multiplier.
