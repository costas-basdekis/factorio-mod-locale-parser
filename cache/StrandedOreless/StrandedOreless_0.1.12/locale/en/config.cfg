stranded-msg-intro-text=As a result of your ship crashing on an unknown planet, you've woken from stasis suddenly and are not sure where you are. You're hurt, hungry and this place doesn't seem very hospitable.
stranded-msg-intro-text2=As you start to get your wits about you, you realize there doesn't seem to be any liquid water anywhere, and you're sure this place is full of hostile monsters. Maybe there's something you can do with your ship's wreckage to save yourself.
stranded-msg-intro-text3=After tearing apart the wreckage of your ship, you were able to salvage some useful equipment and materials, next you need to figure out how you're going to get some water and food.

[entity-name]
rubble-processor=Rubble Processor
rubble-processor2=Rubble Processor Mk2
moisture-vaporator=Moisture Vaporator
crashed-spaceship=Crashed Ship

[entity-description]
rubble-processor=Extremely basic assembly machine that can process rubble into usable resources.
rubble-processor2=Allows for processing rubble directly into end products for some materials, rather than just the ore.
moisture-vaporator=Slowly harvests water from the air.
crashed-spaceship=Your ship appears to be quite destroyed, hopefully you can scavange some resources from it.

rubble-processor=Extremely basic assembly machine that can process rubble into resources.
rubble-processor2=Allows for processing rubble directly into end products for some materials, rather than just the ore.
moisture-vaporator=Converts air into water.
edible-dirt=Yeah, it's dirt but at least your body can metabolize it.
synthetic-food=It doesn't taste great, but it will keep you alive. Just try not to think about the fact that you made it from dirt.
