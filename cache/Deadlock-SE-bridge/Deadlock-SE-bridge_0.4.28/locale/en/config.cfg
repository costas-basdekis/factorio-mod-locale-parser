[mod-setting-description]
dl-se-min-crating=Minimal stack size for an item to be cratable by this mod. Crating density is derived from stack size, so a low stack size item crate won't save nearly as much belt space as a high stack size item crate. Has no effect if crating is not enabled.
dl-se-move-crating-machines=Move crating machinese to the logistics tab, under beltboxes. Has no effect if crating is not enabled.
dl-se-hide-crates=Hides crating\uncrating recipes from player crafting. Warning: this means you can't pack\unpack crates by hand. Has no effect if crating is not enabled.
dl-se-extended-stacking=Stack extra intermediates items in the new resource production chain. Meant to be used with the Stacked recipes mod.
dl-se-loader-update=Automatically replaces all non-space loaders to white loaders on load.\n on-init: only works when the mod is added to the save. (default) \n on-configuration-changed: works every time something is changed (select this if you want to change the loaders and the mod was already enabled) \n off: don't change the loaders at all.
dl-se-ore-stack-override=Overrides the ore stacks created by Stacked mining, to fix missing unlock.
ds-se-stacked-rocket-parts-override=If enabled, rocket part packing/unpacking will be done in beltboxes, instead of assemblers.
