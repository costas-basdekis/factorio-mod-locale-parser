[technology-description]
energy-condensing = Unlock the very core of every thing in existence, Energy Matter Currency. WIP
energy-condensing-2 = Acquires new knowledge about the condensing of items which might be able to show you how to condense even more and more complicated items.
energy-condensing-3 = This will allow you to condense even the most hard to create items to EMC.
usefulEMC = these interesting trades from EMC allows you to think of ways to turn EMC into items
usefulEMC-2 = by learning about the new trades of EMC you get the idea that you might be able to make even more complex items from EMC.
usefulEMC-3 = These advanced ideas might help you with condensing EMC into even more items.
purified-matter = Some items really need a lot of EMC. With this knowledge added to what you already know about EMC, you should be able to purify matter.
purified-matter-2 = "With these smart new technologies that you have been thinking of for a while you might be able to even more purify the matter."
purified-matter-3 = "you recently had an idea. This idea allowed you to research the compression of purified matter."
fluid-to-EMC = Creating EMC with fluids or fluids with EMC is something that you have wanted to do for a while now. With your renewed ideas about how fluids might work you think you have a big change as to achieve this goal.
