# enable-for-all-tiers=Enable this if you want to apply settings for all logistics robots, construction robots, and roboports. (ex, boblogistics)
robot-energy-tick-usage-multiplier=Mulitplier for amount of energy used when robots are not moving. 
roboport-buffer-multiplier=Multiplier for amount of energy stored in roboport
roboport-energy-usage-multiplier=Multiplier for amount of energy usage of roboport when idle
roboport-logistics-radius-multiplier=Roboport logistics radius multiplier. (this may cause problems with other mods)
roboport-construction-radius-multiplier=Roboport construction radius multiplier. (this may cause problems with other mods)
roboport-logistics-radius-value=Roboport logistics area value. -1 will use the radius multiplier only. Other values will multiply this value and the multiplier. (this may cause problems with other mods)
roboport-construction-radius-value=Roboport construction area value. -1 will use the radius multiplier only. Other values will multiply this value and the multiplier. (this may cause problems with other mods)

[technology-description]
early-character-logistic-slots=Allows you to request items from the logistic network. The items will be delivered by logistic robots.
early-character-logistic-trash-slots=Allows you to send unwanted items to the logistic network. The items will be taken away by logistic robots.
early-worker-robots-storage=Increases the number of items that logistic and construction robots can carry at once.
early-worker-robots-speed=Increases the flying speed of logistic and construction robots.
