[mod-setting-description]
xxand-enriching-hardcore-mode=If enabled, the default iron and copper plate recipies are modified to make them more expensive to make with unrefined ores. This provides extra encouragement to refine all your ores.
xxand-enriching-coal-plus=If enabled, rebalances by making coal twice as effective as a fuel.
