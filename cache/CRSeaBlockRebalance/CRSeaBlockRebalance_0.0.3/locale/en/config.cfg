[mod-setting-description]
CRSeaBlockRebalance-EnableBorers=Turns the water boring techs back on for Bob's "Water Pumps". Note that you'll need to enable Bob's Plates "groundwater" setting ("Enable ground water boring recipes"), and the rebalance disables the purified water recipe from those pumps.
