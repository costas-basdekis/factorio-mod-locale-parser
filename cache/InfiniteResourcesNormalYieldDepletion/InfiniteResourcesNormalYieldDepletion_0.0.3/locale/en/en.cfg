[mod-setting-description]
InfiniteResourcesNormalYieldDepletion_minimum=The minimum % the infinite resource will deplete to.
InfiniteResourcesNormalYieldDepletion_normal=The "normal" value for infinite resources.  For the purposes of this mod, this is used to determine how quickly the infinite resource will deplete from 100% to the set minimum value at a rate of 100/value in percentage points.\nA value of 100 will cause it to deplete at a rate of 1% per mining cycle.\nValues under 100 will cause it to deplete faster.  25 means 4% per mining cycle, 50 is 2% per cycle, etc.\nValuse over 100 will cause it to deplete slower.  200 means 1% per 2 mining cycles, while 400 is 1% per 4 cycle, etc.
InfiniteResourcesNormalYieldDepletion_exclusions=Resources to exclude from the affects of this mod.  Names must be entered using their internal game names and separated by commas, with no spaces.\n\nExamples:\nTo exclude only iron ore, type: iron-ore\nTo exclude iron and stone ores, type: iron-ore,stone
InfiniteResourcesNormalYieldDepletion_startOnly=Enable if you want this to affect starting resources only.\n\nNote, changing this to true in a running game will delete all resource tiles this mod converted to infinite outside of the starting area and cannot be undone without loading a prior save.
