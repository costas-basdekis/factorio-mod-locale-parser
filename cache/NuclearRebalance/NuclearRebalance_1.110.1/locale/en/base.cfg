dirty-uranium-enrichment=A vastly inferior form (compared to Kovarex) of uranium enrichment that is also far simpler, at the cost of materials. This recipe causes an incredible amount of pollution, consider placing it in a fortress location away from your base.

lwr-tech-step-one=Fuel and fuel reprocessing for the new Light Water Reactor.
lwr-tech-step-two=Components to build the electircal interface and building blocks for Light Water Reactors (LWR).
lwr-tech-step-three=Turbine Hall and associated components for building LWR turbines.

lmr-fuel-and-mats=Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor coolant fluid, fuel materials, and composite alloys.
lmr-turbine-tech=Turbine Hall and associated components for a LMR reactor.
lmr-tech-final=Reactor Hall, associated components, and electrical interface for a LMR. Features over a LWR: 12% more fuel utilization (100 u238 = more power than in LWR!), same resources. Higher plant efficiency overall (1GJ = more power!), need for u235 all but removed once the reactor is online.

msr-tech-step-one=Unlike LWRs and LMRs Molten Salt Reactors do their fuel reprocessing online. Because of this, they can extract nearly 100% of the energy in the fuel given enough time. Additionally, because they are breeder reactors, they also create all their own fuel, meaning you only need u235 to get the reactor started. Of course, u235 can be tossed in as fuel as well. Additionally, byproducts of online reprocessing only need to be stored for around 300 years. A self-assembling underground bunker will house the short-lived byproducts until they decay to safe levels.
msr-tech-step-two=The higher temperatures that a MSR can operate at allow for use of a gas turbine cycle instead of a steam turbine cycle. This dramatically increases the efficiency and safety of the system. The downside is that the turbine blades must be redesigned to handle this different working medium.
msr-tech-final=Final assembly for a MSR.
