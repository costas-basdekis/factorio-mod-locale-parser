[item-description]
nuclear-artillery-shell=A heavy artillery shell loaded with uranium, dealing widespread damage.

[mod-setting-name]
nuclear-seperate-bonuses=Nuclear artillery infinite technology
nuclear-speed-cost=Nuclear artillery infinite technology cost

[mod-setting-description]
nuclear-seperate-bonuses=Enables infinite technology which increases the shooting speed of the nuclear artillery. The range bonus is covered by the base technology.
nuclear-speed-cost=A modifier which increases the cost of the shooting speed research. The formula used to calculate the cost is: cost_modifier*(1000+3^(L-1)*1000), where L is the research level and cost_modifier is this value.
