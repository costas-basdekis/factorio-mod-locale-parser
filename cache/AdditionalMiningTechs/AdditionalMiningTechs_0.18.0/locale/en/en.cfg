[technology-description]
AMT-mining-up2=By combining technology used to facilitate greater automation with combustion engines, you are able to create a basic Jackhammer for use. While it is not much more affective than your Steel Axe, at least you don't have to swing it.
AMT-mining-up3-p1=Improvements in technologies related to chemical compounds and material processing allow you to make sturdier tools that are easier to operate, and less likely to break down.
AMT-mining-up3-p2=Research into Low Density Structures has yielded many improvements. The least of which is allowing you to optimise the casing of your tools. Combined with high-touque electric engines, this allows you to create a Portable Mining Drill.
AMT-mining-up3-p3=By utilising the complex electronics you have created for the Rocket Control Unit, you are able to control rapid pulsing lasers to increase your ability to mine, without increasing your ability to shoot a hole through yourself with a laser.
AMT-mining-upgrade-final= The Material Oscillation Hand Held Terrain Deformation Assistant Device, or "MOHHTDAD" for short, is an advanced device used for manipulating terrain using oscillating waves of energy. In simpler terms, its a sonic pick axe.
