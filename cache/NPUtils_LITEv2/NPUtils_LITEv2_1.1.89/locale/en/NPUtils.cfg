page_NPUtils_LITEv2_text_1=make sure to check mod settings! a lot of customization there. you can disable almost everything from this mod.\nBefore starting a playthrough it's recommended (although not needed) to toggle mod features inside game settings according to preferences.   \n\n This mod has a lot of extra compatibility with a lot of Big mods, it was designed as a complementary to any of the big names like: \n\n -Bob\n-Angel\n-Krastorio2\n-Space Exploration\n-PYsuite(soon)\n-Industrial Revolution 2\n
menu_cat=Shortcuts
title_cat=very usefull!
page_cat_text_1=\n\nF1 = toggle running speed(mod settings runscript toggle enabled[probably good idea to change vanilla F1 shortcut to something else]).\n\n Vanilla: make sure to set blueprint flipping buttons, very usefull! \n\nOther mods:\n\n(krastorio2)\nShift +L = switch inserter output mode \nShift +M = change roboport mode\n\n(module inserter)\nctrl +i =toggle UI\n\n(picker belts)\n ALT +R = reverse belt direction\n\n(queue to front)\nAlt +Q = toggle manual recipe crafting order(front or default)\n\n(link chests)\nctrl +O = link chest selector\n\n(deadlock stacked mining)\nAlt +M = selector tool(shift +select to reverse ore back to orginal)\n\n(tag to teleport)\nctrl +1,2,3etc = tp to saved location\n\n(jetpack)\nJ=toggle jetpack\n\n(space exploration)\nN=navigation satellite gui\nU=universe explorer GUI\n\n(what is it really used for?)\nctrl +F = while holding item search it's recipe; empty hand, open gui;
menu_dog=Recommended mods
title_dog=small mods but very usefull
page_dog_text_1=Actual_Craft_Time=a hidden gui which shows exacly how much X amount of Xentity produces Xitems; works with almost everything; shows itself only when Xentity gui is open\n\nClosestFirst=optimizes construction bots to prioritize close interactions\n\nCopyPasteModules=copying entity settings also copies its modules\n\nDeadlockResearchNotifications\n\ndistribution-centers=nobody knows about it and yet its so good\n\nGhostScanner=good for LTN\n\ninventory-repair\n\nPickerBeltTools=belt reversing, belt highligh, multi belt-line building\n\nPickerPipeTools=pipehighligh\n\npump=works with any fluid/gas! automatically place pumpjacks(or other modded)\n\nQueueToFrontNG\n\nwhat-is-it-really-used-for=preatty much must have for any modded playthrough; shows all recipes\n\n

runspeedtoggleenabled=Enable this if you want 0 annoyence during gameplay, no longer car rides from A to B, no longer wasting time on traveling; it's only balanced if you don't care about rpg side of the game, otherwise leave it off.



hcmining=balances 'Texugo TA-miners'. fits mining area to the size of miner(just like vanilla), slower(still crazy fast) BUT changes recipes to make them avalible early. MK2 and MK3 mine 15item/s, higher tier = more module slots.

disableOreOil=Toggle if you don't want the new Ore trippling or playing with PySuite/Angel. Hides or Removes completely ore processing buildings, removes some of it's tech, removes Oil recipes.

removecomplexpreview=if other mods, with high recipe complexity cause lag when hovering over some of these, enable this, will completely remove recipe calculation(doesn't affect gameplay).
waterore=works with any modded ore/gas/liquid, should be everything compatible. perfect for island/ocean type maps
red-x=alt power generator and other. if hardmode enabled used in other recipes.

waredupremove=if warehousing mod - Krastorio warehouses; if belts enabled - Krastorio belts; if spaceexploration - chunk excavator; for these preferring A<B mod without having duplicates. (only hides other mods tech/recipes! doesn't prevent game from loading them though!)
warehouse-size=default=500; min=48; max=4000; Includes the logistic warehouses too! why lower the size of their inventory? reduces latency
storehouse-size=default=100; min=48; max=4000; Includes the logistic storehouses too! why lower the size of their inventory? reduces latency



thiccwire=makes Green and Red wires more visible, makes them fatter, thicker. (just a graphic change)

MDtrainsMisc=adds Braking force technology with up to 90levels each 0.10% ; 3 late game fuels to power your Locomotives
wagonmd=adds a 1:1 copy of a vanilla wagon except it has triple inventory.

hardmodeone=more difficult recipes, 'balances' stuff, making things harder. only effects few things.

high-pressure-multiplier=default vanilla value, 1.

beltsssss=additional faster belts, underground, splitters.

overpowered33=assembling machine 4 and 5, extreme fast furnace
overpowered333=productivity module(35%)



modulessss=proviedes different kind early-game modules, less powerefull than vanilla mk3 modules but still really nice. also early game mobile-power-source which is worse than vanilla solar but easy to craft.

infresr=Don't enable with combination of 'Stacked mining' AND 'space exploration'(unless separately)

prodfix=All productivity modules work on any recipe; still can't be used in beacons tho
longrangeturrets=double range for Laser and MachineGun Turrets

runspeeedtoggle-speed1=This is expected to be the smallest modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).
runspeeedtoggle-speed2=This is expected to be the middle speed modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).
runspeeedtoggle-speed3=This is expected to be the largest modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).






tilestacksize=don't switch off after starting a world
waterturret=long range, runs on water(slows enemy by 50%, deals no dmg) or steam(deals some dmg). can use pressurised water for even more dmg
altrecipes=usefull if playing high diff modpack. assemblers; rail; concrete; wood->landfill; free cliff grenade; 
biterbullets=*fight fire with fire; create temporary spitters that fight for you

inventorysize= default = 50, min = 10, max = 1000

botspeed=toggle botspeed bonus, on or off (better not touch this after already started a map)
botspeed-base-bot-speed=Base speed of construction and logistic robots(before bonuses), in tiles/second (default: 0.06)

far-reach-build-distance-bonus=Bonus distance for building. Can be up to 2000. Also works in map view. Set to zero for vanilla experience.
far-reach-reach-distance-bonus=Bonus distance for interacting. Can be up to 700. Set to zero for vanilla experience.
