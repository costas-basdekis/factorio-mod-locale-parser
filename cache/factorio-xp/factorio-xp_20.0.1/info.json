Replaces the ingame music with the Windows XP startup sound, installation music and tour music. Almost all 'core' sounds have been replaced with sounds from Windows XP. Any good ideas for other sounds to be replaced with Windows XP ones? Contact me [here](https://misscattrap.uk#contact). I do not plan to do any 'base' game sounds as it doesn't fit in (as sounds for machines, etc) and there is just too many, but if you have a REALLY good suggestion, please send it over :)"}
