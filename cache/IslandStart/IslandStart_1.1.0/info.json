{"name": "IslandStart", "version": "1.1.0", "factorio_version": "1.1", "title": "Island Start", "author": "Yehn", "dependencies": ["base >= 1.1"], "description": "Allows map presets that attempts to give you an island start, but with other islands/continents instead of the infinite ocean from vanilla's Island mode. If you wish for a biter-free start, please use map preview - as your starter island may collide with a larger island. Also offers a mode using vanilla terrain generation but with a guaranteed island."}
