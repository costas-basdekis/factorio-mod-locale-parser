[mod-setting-description]
k2_air_purifier_readd=Re-enable K2 Air Purifiers if you want.
transmat_readd=Keep this on if you want to use Industrial Revolution 2's Transmat (normally disabled if K2 is installed).
planetary_teleporter=Keep this on if you want to use Krastorio 2's Planetary Teleporter.
tech_card_change=Changes Tech Card recipes to have crafting time of 20 seconds, but produce 5 times the results, like in K2. Also adds 5 Blank Tech Cards as ingredients for them.
lab_speed_change=Sets Advanced Lab speed to 4 and Singularity Lab speed to 10 so that the speed for the labs are Singularity > Quantum > Advanced > Electric > Copper, which matches tech progression.
quantum_lab_recipe_tweak=Adds Advanced Lab as an ingredient to the Quantum Lab recipe.
green-circuit-wood-removal=Normally, wood is part of the ingredient if K2 is also installed. Can remove it if preferred, since Glass is already used as an insulator, so removing wood make it more "realistic."
atomic-artillery-recipes=Keep the regular atomic artillery shell from IR2 or the K2 one or both.
grinder-setting=Regular is default.\nAssembling Machine turns Crushers into Assembling Machines so you have to select the ingredients.\nThis setting is useful because you can place Productivity Modules into Crushers, but you can insert an ingredient for a recipe that can't use Productivity Modules, so it just becomes a wasted module slot.
arc-furnace-speed=Allows Arc Furnace to be affected with Speed Modules (default: false).
