Function otherwise like regular Heat-Exchangers. Use a less valuable resource to first heat water to 165\u00b0C seperately, ie. waste wood in regular burner-boilers, or solar-panel powered Electric-Boilers, thus saving the energy so used to heat 15\u00b0C water to 165\u00b0C steam.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["base"]}
