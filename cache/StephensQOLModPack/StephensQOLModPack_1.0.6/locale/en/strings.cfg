menu_Nanobots=Nanobots
title_Nanobots=Nanobots
page_Nanobots_text_1=Robot enhancements from the start of the game.\nLearn how to create powerful but consumable robots after learning automation. Get up and running fast by using these robots to help you build your way up to Roboports and even smarter robots. Add modules to your power armor to reprogram your personal roboport to complete mundane tasks automatically. Place roboport interfaces to have your logistic networks perform tasks while you are away.\n\nNanobots\n*Pre bot version of ghost building construction bots. Allows researching automated construction earlier (for blueprints etc).\n*Equip the Nano Emitter and some Nano ammo, make it your selected gun and any ghosts/blueprints within 7.5 tiles of you will be automatically built if you have the items in your inventory.\n*Technologies exist to slightly increase the range and speed of your nanobots.\n*These earlier version bots are capable of building, deconstructing and healing. They do not replenish (each Ammo magazine will build 10 items)\n*Nanobots do not work inside logistic networks that contain construction robots, or personal roboport zones without an interface module installed in your power armor.\n*Manually shooting nanobots releases a pretty cloud of nanobots and nothing else. This is a good way to waste nanobots.\nAmmo Details[/font]\n*Nano Constructors - These nanobots will revive ghosts in their range, heal damaged structures, and deconstruct marked items.\n*Nano Termites - These nanobots will kill off trees. This process causes the tree to topple over and may damage nearby structures.

menu_Power_Armor_MK3=Power Armor MK3
title_Power_Armor_MK3=Power Armor MK3

menu_Repair_Turret=Repair_Turret
title_Repair_Turret=Repair_Turret
page_Repair_Turret_text_1=There are 3 technologies:\n- Repair turret. Unlocks the repair turret recipe.\n- Repair turret power. Increases the repair power. Increases the number of beams the turret fires.\n- Repair turret efficiency. Increases the power efficiency of the repair turret repairing. Decreases the energy needed per beam.\n\nThe repair turrets require repair packs to work. If they don't have any in their own inventory, they will look for one in the logistic network, and it will be 'zooped' over the network, draining some electric energy on each hop.\n\nThe repair turret also acts like a charging station for robots, and extends the construction range.\nWhat this means, is that in the early/mid-game with green science, you can build repair turret 'network' around your walls. Then once you have roboports and construction robots, you don't have to also go out and build roboports, the repair turrets will allow the construction bots to function.

menu_VoidChestPlus=Void Chest Plus
title_VoidChestPlus=Void Chest Plus
page_VoidChestPlus_text_1=Instantly destroying anything placed inside as UPS friendly as possible. Can't be used to generate items.

menu_OutpostPlanner=Outpost Planner
title_OutpostPlanner=Outpost Planner
page_OutpostPlanner_text_1=Automatically builds mining outposts. The tool will place the miners, power poles and belts before merging together the outgoing lanes.\n\nIt is intended to make the late-game grind of building outposts a little easier.\n\nTo use select an ore patch with the tool.\nBy default the the mod will clear trees and rocks in the area selected, if shift is held then friendly entities will be deconstructed as well, keep in mind that the resulting outpost may be bigger than just the ore patch itself.\n\nDetailed instructions and a changelog is available in the README file which is visible on GitHub.

menu_VehicleSnap=Vehicle Snap
title_VehicleSnap=Vehicle Snap
page_VehicleSnap_text_1=Have you ever faced a problem when trying to drive exactly along a road, coastline or railroad, that car moves a tiny bit off to side? Then this mod helps. Originally the vehicle can have angle of say 0.123 degrees, when car would look like straight angle. The mod would snap that to closest: 0 degrees.\n\nThis mod makes car smoothly snap into 16 (or player chosen in mod settings) angles when player has not turned for a few ticks. Initially i tested with snapping only the 8 diagonal angles, but in practice it was destructive when driving in tight base corridors. 16 angles just felt better to me.\n\nCar and tank are supported so far, turning while driving. Some modded vehicles may work too.\n\nBy default you can toggle snapping on/off with Shift-V, but you can change that in controls menu. Mod settings menu allow you to change snapping amount per player. 16 different angles is the default but 8 would also work well, it includes all straight directions that railways can move at.

menu_CursorEnhancements=Cursor Enhancements
title_CursorEnhancements=Cursor Enhancements
page_CursorEnhancements_text_1=Cursor Enhancements "enhances" the cursor with these new features:\n\n[font=heading-2]Related items scrolling[/font]\nUsing shift + mousewheel, you can quickly scroll between related items. If you don't have an item when you scroll to it, the ghost cursor will be set instead. If you are in cheat mode or the map editor, instead of setting the ghost cursor, you will be given a new stack of that item for free.\n\nThe mod will auto-detect an entity's upgrades and downgrades and automatically set paths for those, but other mods can override these paths. For example, Cursor Enhancements itself adds various custom paths, including one for electric poles and one for inserters Other mods can tap Cursor Enhancements' remote interface to add their own overrides. See the Remote Interface documentation for instructions. Additionally, each player can add their own overrides via the mod settings. See the FAQ for format instructions.\n\n[font=heading-2]Automatic ghost transitions[/font]\nIf you run out of an item that places an entity, the item will be immediately swapped with the ghost cursor for that entity, and vice versa. If you are in cheat mode or the map editor, a new stack of items will be spawned into your cursor instead of setting the ghost cursor.\n\n[font=heading-2]Recall last item[/font]\nHit Shift + Q to recall the last item that was in your cursor. If you are out of that item, the ghost cursor will be set, or a new stack will be spawned if you're in cheat mode or the editor.

menu_ammo_loader=Ammo Loader Plus
title_ammo_loader=Ammo Loader Plus

See mod options to enable.\n* Range is 0 (infinite) by default. Can be changed in mod options for balance.

menu_LootChestPlus=Loot Chest Plus
title_LootChestPlus=Loot Chest Plus
page_LootChestPlus_text_1=Automagically collects alien-artifacts, corpses, alien-biomass, artifact-ore and flesh. Useful in combination with artillery. Convenient for mods that add loot when aliens die, like Bob's mods, Necromant, Reika's EndgameCombat, Alien Loot Economy and Alien Space Science. The chest acts now as a passive provider chest and gets unlocked with logistic-robotics tech.

menu_autobuild=Autobuild
title_autobuild=Autobuild
page_autobuild_text_1=Autobuild allows your character to automatically build nearby entity blueprint ghosts when standing still, and to deconstruct nearby entities. I find Nanobots a more balanced addition overall, but for a mod pack like SeaBlock where getting more than a trickle of metal takes a while, nanobots is still rather painful.
