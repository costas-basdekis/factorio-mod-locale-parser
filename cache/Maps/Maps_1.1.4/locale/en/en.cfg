MAPS-size=Incidentally, all of the maps show a perfectly square area. Here, you can set the side length of this area.\n__ENTITY__small-map__: Map size * 0.75\n__ENTITY__map__: Map size\n__ENTITY__big-map__: Map size * 1.5\n(Default: 200)
MAPS-marker-color=Enter the color code in HTML notation (hexadecimal number with 6 digits, e.g. "#f18820") or as a comma-separated list of 3 numbers in the range 0â€¦255 (e.g. "241.4, 135.9, 32.4")!\n(Default: f18820)
MAPS-marker-ttl=Map markers will be shown no longer than this time in minutes. If set to 0, markers will be visible until the map they mark has been picked up.\n(Default: 5)
MAPS-marker-altmode=Choose if/when map markers are shown.\n(Default: In ALT-mode)
MAPS-I-speak-for-the-trees=Watch out, destroying trees may reveal hidden enemies! Worms hide in dead trees, biters and spitters prefer living trees.\nThe illiterate critters are suspicious of maps, so you won't ever find them in a tree where somebody has hidden a map.\n(Default: true)
MAPS-BigBrother=Force of the player who picked up a small map of a completely revealed area will gain constant free radar coverage of the chunk where the map was found.\nNote: Only one force may have a given chunk under constant surveillance, so it pays to pick up maps quickly!\n(Default: true)
MAPS-BigBrother-associate-players=Chunks under constant surveillance will be associated with the player who picked up the map. If a player switches over to another force, the chunks associated with that player will become visible to players on the new and invisible to players on the old force.\n(Default: false)
MAPS-BigBrother-radar-chance=Chance that a chunk will be put under constant surveillance when a small map revealing no new area is picked up.\n(Default: 50)
