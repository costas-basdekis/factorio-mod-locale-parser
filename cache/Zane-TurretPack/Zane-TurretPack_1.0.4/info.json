Krastorio2 >= 1.0.7"], "description": "Adds turrets using the graphics made available by this mod: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rp-turrets .  I had nothing to do with the making of these new sprites, I'm just using them in accordance with the wishes of the guy that released them.  This mod is an extension of my previous turret mod (Zane's Car Turret).  Adds several new turrets, including a Sniper turret, a Grenade turret, and Plasma turrets.  This mod supports Krastorio 2 and Vortik's Cannon Turret mod.  These turrets really pop off when you have the More Realistic Weapons setting from Krastorio 2 enabled as it turns the Baby and Sniper turrets into anti-materiel turrets  Adds an anti-materiel ammo specifically for use in those turrets to avoid friendly fire.  Feel free to leave feedback, especially if the new turret sounds are too loud or quiet, or if the turrets are too cheap or costly or if you have other balancing concerns."}
