[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
life-pods-intro=Welcome to the Life Pods mod! You are the Repair&Rescue robot from a spaceship which suffered a catastrophic failure in space around this planet. You must keep alive as many of the surviving humans as possible until rescue arrives. For now they are all in orbital lifepods, but over time the lifepods will suffer failures and require your aid.
life-pods-humans=In the upper left of the main screen you can see the status of the human survivors. At the start of the game they're all in space, but over time they'll come down to the surface. Your goal is to keep as many as possible out of the Dead state! If enough humans die, then you lose entirely.
life-pods-feeding=Each Life Pod that lands needs to consume a certain item.\nYou can mouse over the life pod to see more info.\nAs you insert the needed item, the life pod will turn it into "Hearts" which it will consume over time.
life-pods-damage=Life Pods with no hearts will take damage over time. If they lose 1000 health, one of the humans aboard will die.\nIn the life pod mouseover you can see how long before this life pod loses a human.\nEach pod starts with 10 human survivors. As survivors die, the pod will consume hearts proportionally slower.\nIf all the humans aboard die, the pod will be removed from the game.\nIf a damaged pod gets an excess of hearts, it will restore health to the damaged survivor (but it will never recover dead people).
life-pods-speedup=The humans in a life pod accelerate all nearby machinery, granting +100% speed to all nearby buildings which accept module effects (with no increase in power consumption or pollution). The life pod acts like an enormous beacon with an awesome module. Like a beacon, you can see its area of effect when you have a relevant entity in your hand (blue assembling machine is a good bet).\nIf you can build parts of your base near life pods, they will be dramatically more efficient!
life-pods-radar=In addition to their normal uses, Radars will detect incoming life pods. The more radars you have, the sooner you will get warning about the next life pod, where it will land, when it will land, and how much it will consume.
life-pods-stabilization=Build [item=life-pods-repair-module] to completely stabilize a life pod. Once the module is inserted into a life pod, it will very slowly begin its work.\n4 hours later, the life pod will be Stabilized, and no longer need resources. Humans in stabilized life pods are completely safe and cannot die.\nEach module contains exactly enough charge to fully stabilize one life pod and then is used up.\n\nThe bar will turn green when the existing hearts are enough to last until stabilization finishes.
life-pods-stabilization-nudge=Tech to [technology=life-pods-repair-module] quickly, to limit the accumulating resource consumption of the life pods.
life-pods-h-menu=Press __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__H__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ to bring up a summary of your current life pods.
life-pods-stabilization-advanced=Advanced Stabilization Modules work like regular modules, while also providing a secondary benefit.\n\n[item=life-pods-damage-reduction-module-1] increase the lifetime of humans while they have no hearts.\n[item=life-pods-consumption-module-1] increase the hearts produced from each input item.\n[item=life-pods-science-module-1] cause the humans to occasionally increase progress towards their favorite available tech. If their favorite tech becomes invalid, they choose a new favorite tech among those available at the appropriate level.\n\nScience modules can be used by already-stabilized life pods. It can be worthwhile to put a science module in all your stable life pods and get frequent random tech boosts.
