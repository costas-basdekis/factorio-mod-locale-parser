[mod-setting-description]
capsule-ammo-combination-levels=If you have mods that add more capsules then a high setting (3 or more) can grow the number of recipes, ammo items and researches created to insanly high numbers. But with just vanilla capsules there's only a few thousand possible combinations so go nuts if you want to.

capsule-ammo-technology='No' means all recipes are enabled by default. 'Levels only' means research for each amount of capsules is needed. 'Individual recipes' means one research to unlock each recipe, but no research for the levels and no prerequisites on the ingredients used (ammo and capsules). 'Complete' is everything combined with the addition of prerequisites for the ingredients (so you can't unlock recipes which require ingredients you haven't unlocked yet). The research graph for 'Complete' looks a bit messy in the research viewer because of the way Factorio orders things so at least in the alpha version the other options are provided for testing purposes.

capsule-ammo-magazine-fraction=For each individual bullet shot this will be used as a probability of triggering each capsule effect individually. The recipe cost will be scaled accordingly, rounded up to the nearest whole capsule, so multiples of 0.1 are preferred to not have to pay more than necessary. This value exists because a value of 1.00 (100%) means that you launch capsules at an insanely high rate. Simple grenade magazines or almost any other capsule becomes many times stronger than uranium rounds instead of being a utilty round.

capsule-ammo-recipe-type=Simple means 1 of each thing on the icon. Complex means you need the subset ammo types as ingredients instead of capsules. Poison + Slowdown capsules in a explosive rocket then requires poison capsule explosive rocket and slowdown capsule explosive rocket. "Complex, cheap" (cheaper than "Simple") means you get the as many output ammo items as inputs used, which effectivly means you pay 1 capsule per ammo regardless of level. Or 2 explosive rockets + 1 poison capsule + 1 slowdown capsule finally ends up as 2 explosive rockets with poison + slowdown. "Complex, expensive" (more expensive than "Simple") always gives 1 ammo output, which effectivly means you pay more ammo items but the same number of capsules as the simple recipe. Cost in ammo items (not counting the capsules) is then n_capsules factorial, or for 1 capsule ammo with 1 to 4 capsules it costs 1, 2, 6, 24 ammo items in total.
