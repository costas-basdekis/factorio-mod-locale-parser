[mod-setting-description]
simplified-max-intermediate-tier=Tier descriptions are reliably in Vanilla only!
simplified-tier-based-cost-reduction=Reduction is based on tier; high tier items are reduced more than low tier ones.
simplified-tier-based-cost-reduction-for-technology=Reduction is based on tier; high tier items are reduced more than low tier ones.
simplified-item-count-crop-strategy=This is the maximum number of ingredients on a recipe; includes any fluids
