#item description
[item-description]
umr_core_item=This is the core of the UMR. The full setup of core, amplifier, interfaces, output and converter will produce extreme amounts of energy, heat, steam: your choice! This reactor system can convert mostly any fuel (burnable, fission, fusion...) fed into interfaces to usable energy.

bk_umr_overview=Overview
bk_umr_about=About the mod
bk_umr_about_text=This mod adds a universal reactor, consisting of different modules. It can turn vanilla and modded fuels into power, furnace or crafting machine fuel. Will supply all the power you ever need!

bk_umr_concept=Produce massive amounts of energy!
bk_umr_concept_text=Interfaces (shown below) can be used to convert nearly any fuel into Raw energy. Each fuel will provide 1 Raw Energy[fluid=umr_interface_fluid] for each 100MJ of its burn value. Since this mod is made to be very easy integrateable (see modding section) fuels from other mods, by deafault including youki, RFP, Krastio2 and 248k, can be used. This Fluid[fluid=umr_interface_fluid] will then be used by the amplifier to make it suitable for reaction in the UMR core, which will turn it into Extreme Radiating Energy[fluid=umr_core_fluid].  Extreme Radiating Energy[fluid=umr_core_fluid] is consumed by a output resulting in Usable Energy[fluid=umr_output_fluid]. This energy can be used in converters to turn it into energy (max 10GW), heat (can result above 10GW) or to power some very fast assemblers or furnaces.    

bk_umr_modding=Mod usage
bk_umr_modding_text=This mod comes with a umrlib, which can be found in data. If you are a fellow modder and factorian and like to integrate fuels and energy producing recipes into the umr mod - you can use the functions provided by the umrlib to do so!
