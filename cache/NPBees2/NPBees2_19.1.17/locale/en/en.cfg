[entity-description]
liquiformer-1=Liquefies combs before casting them into molds and honey
liquiformer-2=Allows liquiforming to happen faster by turning solids into foams instead of liquids
sequencer=Uses raw materials and mutated propolis to create custom DNA.
n-genetic-transposer=Transposes DNA into bees to change their species. Requires lots of energy
n-hive-t1=A basic hive for honey production
n-hive-t2=An advanced hive used to create raw materials
n-hive-t3=An climate-controlled hive with optimizations to increase bee speed
apiary=Incubates larva until they reach adulthood
n-logistic-hive=An isolated interface with the logistic network, perfect for congested areas. Does not have charging ports, and is suited for bees

bee-process-t1=Unlocks bees for the production of honey
bee-process-t2=Allows advanced methods of cultivating bees
n-logistic-hive=Massively enlarges beehives and installs roboport functionality. The hive mentality goes against forming logistic networks, as bees stick to their hive

n-bee-research=Unlocks __1__ bees for renewable cultivation

mutation-modifier=Mutation modifier
max-mutation-chance=Max mutation chance
larva-modifier=Larva modifier

[mod-setting-description]
disable-bells-and-whistles=Removes the logistic beehive and logistic/construction bees. Useful if you only want ore production. Doesn’t remove the propolis ammo because a propolis void is necessary later on.
disable-corner-icons=Setting to disable “mini-icons” in the corner of recipes. Makes the game look a bit cleaner, but also less informative.
mutation-modifier=There is a flat modifier subtracted to mutation chance. This setting lets you change that modifier. (Mutation chance is capped between max mutation chance and 5 percent)
max-mutation-chance=Changes the maximum chance of successful mutation.
larva-modifier=Increase or decrease the amount of larva a queen can make. Bees become a negative loop under 7.
