The tank costs as much as 100 regular fluid storage tanks (2000 iron plates and 500 steel plates) OR you can make it directly using 100 fluid tanks. Either way, it takes a LONG time to craft.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["base >= 0.18"], "author": "llVIU", "contact": "https://mods.factorio.com/user/llVIU"}
