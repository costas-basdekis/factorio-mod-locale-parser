[mod-setting-description]
pitch-MaxEvolution=The max evolution level the biters can grow too
pitch-ExpansionScale=Scale the expansion rate for the biters (Lower value means less)
pitch-ScalePollutionDamage=Scales how much damage pollution does to biter nests during daylight
pitch-ScaleEvolutionRate=Scalar value for how much the enemy evolves, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies easier, use a smaller value. To make them harder, use a higher value.
pitch-BiterDamageScale=Scalar value for biter damage, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)
pitch-SpitterDamageScale=Scalar value for spitter damage, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)
pitch-PhaseLength=Number of real seconds in a game day\nDefault: 600 (10 minutes)\nNote: A single day is not necessarily the cycle of the sun... E.G there could be multiple days with the sun up.

pitch-FirstDayPhaseMaxLength=Number of "days" making up the first phase of max daylight.\nDefault: 10 (100 minutes if DayLength = 600)\nNote: A single day is not necessarily the cycle of the sun... E.G there could be multiple days with the sun up.

pitch-DebugMode=Debug mode, affects things like how verbose logging is to file.
pitch-EnemyHealthScale=Scalar value for enemy health, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies weaker, use a smaller value. To make them tougher, use a higher value.
pitch-EnemySwarmScale=Scalar value for how much the enemy spawns, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies easier, use a smaller value. To make them harder, use a higher value.
pitch-EnemyMovementScale=Scalar value for enemy movement speed, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)
pitch-addResistances=Adds fire resistance to biters
pitch-disableSmoke=Flamethrower/turret fire doesn't create smoke, may help with stuttering/lag
pitch-BiterDamageModifier=Increases damage by: damage + damage * Damage bonus (like bullet damage research) 
pitch-SpitterDamageModifier=Increases damage by: damage + damage * Damage bonus (like bullet damage research)
