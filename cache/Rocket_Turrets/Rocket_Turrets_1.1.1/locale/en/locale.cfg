[info]
text_intro=Rockets have always been the lame duck, the third wheel of base defense in Factorio. For manual fire, other methods are more effective, and automatic fire was not possible for a long time. But now, you screwed your badonkadonks on a turret socket to make mayhem and explosions rain on biters and spitters.
heading_turrets=New Turrets
text_turrets=You developed new turrets. Sadly, you only had one colour available to paint them. Now the turrets look a bit depressing, but they launch rockets dealing their usual damage.
text_turrets_bob=You developed new turrets, which are glistening in (almost) every colours of the rainbow. The yellow rocket turret deals the rocket's usual damage. Every improvement (MK2-5) increases damage by 25% and range by 2. The turrets MK4-5 can each handle an additional stack of ammunition, too.
heading_ammo=Ammunition
text_ammo=All rockets can be loaded into the rocket turrets. To prevent them from self-destroying, rocket turrets cannot attack enemies inside a radius of 15 around them. Additional care should be taken when using atomic bombs, since the explosion has a far greater radius than that and may therefore cause mayhem over your very own base defenses.
