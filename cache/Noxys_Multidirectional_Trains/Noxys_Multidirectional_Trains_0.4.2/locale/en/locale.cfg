[mod-setting-description]
Noxys_Multidirectional_Trains-on_nth_tick=Maximum delay in ticks between leaving station and speed measurement for rotation.
Noxys_Multidirectional_Trains-enabled=Enables train rotation. Set this to off if you want to remove this mod and have all your trains rotated back.
Noxys_Multidirectional_Trains-station_limits=This makes it so you can use station limits of 1 on your stations and not have the multidirectional trains freak out and constantly go from limit 1 station to the next without actually advancing their schedule. Having this enabled will temporarly raise the station limit to 2 so that the trains can rotate properly. This could have some odd side effects like too many trains attempting to go to that station. If this happens to you, disabling this option should fix that issue.
