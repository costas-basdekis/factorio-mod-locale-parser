spidertron-leg-count=Spidertron Legs (WARNING: PICK UP EVERY SPIDERTRON BEFORE CHANGING)

[mod-setting-description]
spidertron-leg-count=How many legs does a spidertron have? You decide!  IMPORTANT: Due to a base game bug, Factorio will crash if you change this and then load a save that already has a spidertron on the ground.  To work around it for now: Pick up your spidertron(s), save, change this value in mod settings and restart game, and put them back down.
