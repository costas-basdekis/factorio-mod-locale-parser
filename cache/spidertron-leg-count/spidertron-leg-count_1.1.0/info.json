You can customize the number with this mod (affects ALL spidertrons).\n\nIMPORTANT: Due to a base game bug, Factorio will crash if you change this and then load a save that already has a spidertron on the ground.  To work around it for now: Pick up your spidertron(s), save, change this value in mod settings and restart game, and put them back down.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["base"]}
