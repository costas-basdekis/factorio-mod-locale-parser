If there are not enough modules in your inventory, they will be delivered by construction robots.\nUseful if you want to combine different modules in the same machine where quick insert cannot simply achieve, like 3x Efficiency 3 + 1x Speed 3.\nIn addition, this mod makes mining drills, furnaces, labs and beacons copy-and-pastable."}
