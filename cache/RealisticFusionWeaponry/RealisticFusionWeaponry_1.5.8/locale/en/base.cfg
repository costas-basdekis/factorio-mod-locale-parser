rfw-thermonuclear-bomb=Uses fission of uranium[item=uranium-235] to ignite D-T fusion[recipe=rfp-d-t-fusion-0] and release massive amounts of energy. Try not to kill yourself.
rfw-fusion-bomb=This bomb can ignite D-He3 fusion[recipe=rfp-d-he3-fusion-0] reactions without any uranium[item=uranium-235] fission. Do NOT fire it anywhere near anything you don't want destroyed.
rfw-fusion-rounds-magazine=Uses very small amounts of deuterium[fluid=rfp-deuterium] and helium-3[fluid=rfp-helium-3] to make very small nuclear explosions with every hit. Very effective.
rfw-fusion-shotgun-shell=Uses very small amounts of deuterium[fluid=rfp-deuterium] and helium-3[fluid=rfp-helium-3] to make very small nuclear explosions with every hit. Very effective.

rfw-deuterium-plasma-thrower=Flames aren't hot enough? What about plasma that is about 10 thousand times hotter?
rfw-thermonuclear-bombs=These second-generation nuclear bombs (sometimes called H-bombs or hydrogen bombs) use uranium[item=uranium-235] fission to ignite D-T fusion[recipe=rfp-d-t-fusion-0]. They have a much higher energy density and that means their destructive potential is much higher than uranium[item=uranium-235]-only atomic bombs[item=atomic-bomb].
rfw-pure-fusion-bombs=Pure fusion bombs are third-generation nuclear bombs that don't need to use uranium[item=uranium-235] fission at all to ignite their D-He3 fuel[recipe=rfp-d-he3-fusion-0]. Their energy density is even higher than thermonuclear weapons[item=rfw-thermonuclear-bomb], increasing their destructive potential even more.
rfw-fusion-ammo=Pure fusion weapons have no critical mass needed to ignite (unlike uranium[item=atomic-bomb] or thermonuclear[item=rfw-thermonuclear-bomb] bombs), and that means they can effectively be scaled down to any size. That includes bullets, rockets, and cannon shells.
rfw-antimatter-ammo=These weapons use matter-antimatter annihilation which converts 100% of the fuel into energy. For comparison, fusion converts ~0.37% and fission ~0.1%. This means that its energy density is about 270x higher than even pure fusion weapons[item=rfw-fusion-bomb].
rfw-antimatter-bombs=This bomb is so powerful that it is physically impossible to fire it from a handheld rocket launcher[item=rocket-launcher] without dying soon afterwards. Artillery[entity=artillery-turret] seems to be the best option, but even it might not have enough range to guarantee the factory won't get accidentaly blown up by the bomb.

tn-thermonuclear-bomb=15kt yield, roughly equivalent to the Little Boy. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 1000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 3km radius.\n\nFiring this from a handheld rocket launcher is suicide.
tn-fusion-bomb=100kt yield, roughly equivalent to the W-76, used on some Trident SLBMs. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 500m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 2000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 5.5km radius.\n\n

tn-antimatter-bomb=1Mt yield, roughly equivalent to the W-59, used on some Minuteman I ICBMs. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 1200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 5000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 12km radius.\n\nWithout the optimization mod setting turned on (Mod settings > Map > RFW), the explosion will freeze your game for a few minutes. If the optimization is turned on, it will freeze for only a few seconds, but won't damage anything outside of the revealed area on the map. There is no level of caution which will make this weapon safe. For those who wish to watch the world burn, in slideshow form.
tn-antimatter-artillery-shell=[color=#ff3300]50Mt yield, roughly equivalent to the Tsar Bomba, THE most devastating weapon designed and tested to date.[/color]\nWhen detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 6km. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 35km, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 45km radius.\n\nThis weapon is so devastating, that without the optimization mod setting turned on (Mod settings > Map > RFW), the explosion will freeze your game for... pretty much forever. Legends say that this mod's author once tried detonating it, and his game is still frozen to this day. If the optimization is turned on, it will freeze for a few minutes, and won't damage anything outside of the revealed area on the map, although it will easily destroy anything in it.\nThere is absolutely no practical reason you should use this.\nAt all.
