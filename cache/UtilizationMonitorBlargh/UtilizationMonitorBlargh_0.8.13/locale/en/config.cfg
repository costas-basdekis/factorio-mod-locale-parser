utilization-monitor-limit-exceeded=UtilizationMonitorBlargh: The number of entities being monitored has now exceeded how many is permitted to be processed in one tick (__1__).  Accuracy is decreased as every entity is not checked every tick.  If this causes an issue, you can raise the "Maximum updates per tick" setting.
utilization-monitor-stats=UtilizationMonitorBlargh: Currently tracking __1__ entities.
utilization-monitor-reset=UtilizationMonitorBlargh: Reset complete.  Now tracking __1__ entities.
utilization-monitor-help-reset=Resets UtilizationMonitorBlargh, recheck entities, and restart counting.
utilization-monitor-help-stats=Presents some basic statistics about UtilizationMonitorBlargh.

[mod-setting-description]
utilization-monitor-enabled=Whether or not the mod should be enabled. This option is usefull if you want to measure a new part of your factory, but generally want to preserve FPS.
utilization-monitor-show-labels=Whether or not labels should be shown. The working time average will still be calculated.
utilization-monitor-entities-per-tick=The maximum number of entities to update each tick.  If this is insufficient to track all the entities needed, a console message will be generated (once), and this limit enforced, but the data will start being averaged over more than 60 seconds.
utilization-monitor-always-perf=Always calculate the effect energy supply has on the performance of a machine.  If disabled, this is only done if the machine is in Low Power state, but that state only triggers at less than 90.909% energy.  Enabling this increases overhead slightly every tick, for a minor improvement in accuracy in powersituations greater than 90.909% and less than 100%.
utilization-monitor-color-spoolup=This color will be used for averages that have not yet had one full set of metrics (determined by the Seconds to average numbers above), and thus their numbers are not yet accurate.  The color will change to the color below after this is done.
utilization-monitor-force-player=The default Factorio game and most mods will have the entities of interest under the 'player' force. Some mods or configurations may add additional forces (for teams or the like), in which case this should be unchecked. Players will still only be able to see the percentages for buildings their own force controls.
utilization-monitor-label-pos=What corner of the bounding box (the marks you see bracketing the building when you mouse over it) to place the label in. Note that some buildings have graphics outside the bounding box and thus some settings here may not look quite right.
