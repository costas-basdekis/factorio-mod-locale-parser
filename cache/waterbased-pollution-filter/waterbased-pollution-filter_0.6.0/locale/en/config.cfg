water-filter=A machine that uses water jets to trap pollution from the air.
water-filter-mk2=A machine that uses water jets to trap pollution from the air.
polluted-water=Water that contains trapped pollution.
polluted-water-cleaning=Uses coal to filter the pollution out of the water, generating a block of solid pollution over time. Solid polution can be turned into stone bricks.

[item-name]
solid-pollution=Solid pollution

[item-description]
solid-pollution=Pollution collected from the air that has ben turned into a solid block. Can be turned into stone bricks.

[fluid-name]
polluted-water=Polluted water

[fluid-description]
polluted-water=Water that has trapped pollution.

[technology-name]
waterbased-pollution-filtering=Water-based pollution filtering
waterbased-pollution-filtering-mk2=Advanced water-based pollution filtering

[technology-description]
waterbased-pollution-filtering=Passing polluted air trough water jets, contamination can be trapped in the water, then the water is electrolized and the contaminants are collected in a solid block.
waterbased-pollution-filtering-mk2=Improved model of the water filter with increased capacity and range, at the cost of more power consumption.
