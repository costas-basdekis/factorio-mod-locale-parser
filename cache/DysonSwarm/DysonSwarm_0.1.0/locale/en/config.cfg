dyson-statite=Floats at a fixed distance above the sun, held by radiation pressure. Collects solar energy and sends it to a controller.
dyson-swarm-controller=Collects energy from solar statites and sends it to the planet's surface via microwave laser.
microwave-power-receiver=Receives energy transmitted via microwave laser and makes it available to the electric network.
ultra-light-solar-panel=A very thin, very light solar panel; suitable for construction of statites held aloft by radiation pressure.
microwave-power-transmitter=A compact unit capable of transforming electric energy into coherent microwave radiation, or vice versa.
