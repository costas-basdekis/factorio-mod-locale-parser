By itself on Factorio 0.17.60 or later, it merely adds options to produce sulfur from heavy & light oil, with heavy oil having the best efficiency and petroleum gas the worst.  When used in conjunction with the 'Pre 0.17.60 Oil' mod, it makes it so sulfur production comes exclusively from heavy oil (with a setting to enable light and gas).  Concept is to move uses of the oil byproduct fluids around so the system is less demanding on petroleum gas and gives outlets for everything else.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["?Pre0-17-60Oil >= 0.0.3"]}
