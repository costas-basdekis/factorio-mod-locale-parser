[technology-description]
bettercablemaking=Adjustments to the manufacturing process of copper cables lead to 50% more yield. However, you can not get it right with your hands.
evenbettercablemaking=Longer extruder modules in your assembly machines lead to 100% more yield. However, as a result of the longer production route, the production time increases slightly. Time to use Stacks Inserters.
advancedcablemaking=Pressing into a suitable rod shape prior to extrusion results in 200% more yield. Time incrases minimal.
ultimatecablemaking=The previous heating of the copper reduces the stress generated by the pressing, the 300% more yield. The manufacturing time is thus slightly increased.
bettersteelmaking=By enriching with carbon, the demand for iron in steel production can be reduced.
evenbettersteelmaking=Due to increased slag discharges in the furnaces, the demand for iron can be further reduced, but the production time is increased slightly.
advancedsteelmaking=New oxygen sensors in the ovens allow better monitoring of the manufacturing process. However, this makes clear that efficient manufacture require more time.
ultimatesteelmaking=The findings from the Kovarex enrichment process can be used to deliver the exact amount of coal. In addition, we can now directly enrich iron ore, which can saves us the production of plates.
