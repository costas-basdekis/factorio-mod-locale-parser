Mod adds special electric melting furnace and molten form of copper, iron, steel. One copper/iron ore going through the process should result in 2 plates (plates are crafted in standard assembler mk2). Steel is made by melting 5 iron plates to molten steel and crafting it in assembler mk2 (results in 2 steel plates). As a bonus mod gives you molten form of plastic for alternative storage/transport. Mod uses vanilla electric furnace graphic for the smelter atm. It shouldn't cause any incompatibilities. NOT tested in MP. Any suggestions welcome. Have fun! JRT"}
