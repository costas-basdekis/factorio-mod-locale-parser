DelayedRegen-search-logic=Method to determine prototypes to heal.
DelayedRegen-healing-style=How to heal:\npercent of max = % of max health\nflat = add this much\nno healing = no regeneration\ndisable = return healing to base configuration
DelayedRegen-percent-max-per-minute=% of max health per minute\nscales to intervals\n100% per minute heals 1.67% if interval = 1 second
DelayedRegen-flat-per-second=flat health to give, based on seconds passed\n scaled to intervals\n5 health per second is 25 if healed every 5 seconds
DelayedRegen-healing-delay=start healing after this many seconds\ncan use decimals
DelayedRegen-healing-interval=heal every this many seconds\ncan use decimals\nhealing scaled to interval time
DelayedRegen-log-recalculations=log healing information on new game or changed settings
