[item-description]
alluminium-ore=Al; AI:"Basic for structures and intermediates."
cadmium-ore=Cd; AI:"For now i've not found any usage for this resource: a better investigation is needed."
cinnabar-ore=Hgs; AI:"The perfect source for the quicksilver and a good alternative for produce Sulfur."
diamond-ore=C; AI:"Perfect for weapons and late-game alloys, but it could be useful in science production too."
germanium-ore=Ge; AI:"Transistors and electronic circuits in the first years of the 21st century were made of this material: you could use it too for now."
gold-ore=Au; AI:"An element with very good conduction and social properties."
hafnium-ore=Hf; AI:"From my scans i've discovered that it's very good for isolate radiations, more investigation is needed."
iridium-ore=Ir; AI:"Better than steel in duration."
lithium-ore=Li; AI:"Perfect for batteries and complex circuits."
omega's-ametyst-ore=Si§7; AI:"Detected an alien trace in the area, attempting translation:< |@]-[@}*-éçò+è@__}-ò}{éò[@ç<-___ù[@{ç§ç-çç*éç°§ç§:_| >; all downloaded in the databank, more investigations needed for understand the message."
osmium-ore=Os; AI:"Useful element for many alloys."
lead-ore=Pb; AI:"Used and knowed since ancient times of human history"
platinum-ore=Pl; AI:"Used probably in intermediates"
randomite-ore=R*nd§m; AI:"A pretty strange material: it seems it could transfor its composition in almost any element, more investigation is needed."
silicon-ore=Si; AI:"Similar to diamond for the composition, but the use is completely different."
tin-ore=Sn; AI:"Tin is an essential component for almost evrything:your chance of surviving have been greatly increased by 300%"
titanium-ore=Ti; AI:"Better than any other element, exept by Diamond and Vibranium, in duration: used in structures, advanced alloys and space industry."
vibranium-ore=V|b; AI:"Stronger and Better than any other metal ever discovered and nearly unbreakable: Uncommon metal in the solar system: Luke Armstrong become a celebrity for be the only man that found 2.39kg of it there in 2285, in Jupiter's core. It seems you'll become a celebrity too if you survive."
quartz-ore=SiO2; AI:"Found an usage in alloys, researching..."
raw-nickel=Ni; AI:"A rare derivative of the iron"
raw-cobalt=Co; AI:"Corrupted files: trying to fix them"
quicksilver=Hg; AI:"An alien type of our quicksilver: it seems that it's usage could be more large than the commmon one."
raw-sulfur=S; AI"Can be refined for obtain the normal sulfur"
