baron-burner=The Burner faction powers each of their buildings with fuel, making extensive use of belts and inserters.
baron-electric=The Electric faction performs similarly to vanilla Factorio, possibly even made easier without the need to power furnaces with fuel.
baron-heat=The Heat faction creates compact bases with their adjacent reactor bonuses. They have trouble transmitting their power past obstacles though.
baron-steam=The Steam faction has compact bases with the ability to power things at a distance with their long underground pipes.
baron-all=The All faction can create buildings from all the other factions. It is ideal for playing a game with a single faction.
baron-void=The Void faction has buildings that generate free energy. This faction is horribly unbalanced, but is included for completeness.
