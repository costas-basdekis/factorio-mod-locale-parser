color-multiplier="Pulls back" the colours of high-energy fuels. If you've set peak/floor fuel values appropriately, but everything still seems too blue, bump this up.
peak-fuel-value=How the "hotness" of a fuel's tint is calculated. Low values mean more blue. High values mean more red. For best results, set the value to that of the "biggest" fuel you're regularly using. (Default: Nuclear Fuel)
floor-fuel-value=Same deal. Low values mean more red. High values mean more blue. Set the value to that of the "smallest" fuel you're regularly using. (Default: Raw Wood)
lock-vanilla-fuels=Locks the vanilla fuels at sensible colours.
