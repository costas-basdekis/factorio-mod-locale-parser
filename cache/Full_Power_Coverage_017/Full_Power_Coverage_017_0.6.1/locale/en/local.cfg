[mod-setting-description]
full-power-allow-modded=When enabled, this setting will also alter the supply area/wire reach of all power poles added by mods.

full-power-items=A list of item IDs (separated by commas) that should either be whitelisted or blacklisted (depending on mode), if you only want to change the supply area of some power poles.
