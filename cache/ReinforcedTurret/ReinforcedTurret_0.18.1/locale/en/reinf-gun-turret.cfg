[technology-description]
reinf-turrets=Researches reinforced turret bases and gyroscopic stabilization technologies. These turrets have lower firing speed and less range due to the components weights, but provides increased attack damage.
ammo-packs=Researches belt-fed systems that minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the feeding device along with allowing high rates of continuous fire, and allows for continuous fire without the need to open the feed tray and reload. 
ammo-packs2=Researches belt-fed systems that minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the feeding device along with allowing high rates of continuous fire, and allows for continuous fire without the need to open the feed tray and reload. 
ammo-packs3=Researches belt-fed systems that minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the feeding device along with allowing high rates of continuous fire, and allows for continuous fire without the need to open the feed tray and reload.
