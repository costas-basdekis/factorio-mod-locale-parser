car-finder-setting-chirp-volume=The chirp-chirp sound loudness, which can be anything from 0 to 1, inclusive. If the sound is too loud, lower this value. To mute it, set this value to 0
car-finder-setting-show-colors=When printing the list of vehicles, use the color of the vehicle.  For cars/tanks this is usually the color of the last player to drive it.  For spidertrons, this is the color set in the spidertron settings.

car-finder-selected-entity-names=Comma separated list of entity names that should be shown in the search results.\n\nMake this setting empty to show all vehicles.\n\nIf you are playing a mod like AAI that adds many new vehicle entities, start with a list of vanilla names like [color=#e69100]car,tank,spidertron[/color] and you can add in any others that you want to be able to locate.\n\nTo get the entity name, turn on the mod setting to [font=default-bold]Show internal entity names[/font].  Alternatively, you can press F4 to open debug options, check the option for [font=default-bold]show-debug-info-in-tooltips[/font], hover over the vehicle, and write down the [font=default-bold]name[/font] value from the debug section in the tooltip.
car-finder-hidden-entity-names=Comma separated list of entity names that should never be shown in the search results.\n\nThis will take precedence over the show-vehicles setting just above this one.\n\nTo get the entity name, turn on the mod setting to [font=default-bold]Show internal entity names[/font].  Alternatively, you can press F4 to open debug options, check the option for [font=default-bold]show-debug-info-in-tooltips[/font], hover over the vehicle, and write down the [font=default-bold]name[/font] value from the debug section in the tooltip.
