engine-efficiency-tech=Focuses on different ways to increase the amount fuel energy converted to forward momentum.

[entity-description]
efficient-locomotive=Most efficient engine possible uses up to 80% of injected fuel. Can travel very far but takes a long time doing so.
inter-city-locomotive=The way to go when you need peak performance on short to medium ranges.
inter-continental-locomotive=Wastes a lot of fuel for peak performance, nothing is faster than this puppy.
