[mod-setting-description]
bulkteleport-checks-per-second=UPS control for large bases. Checks are lightweight, but with slow teleport cycles it's usually not necessary to check them all every every second.
bulkteleport-show-beam=Display a dashed line between dematerializer and rematerializer during a teleportation cycle. Useful for quickly seeing where shipments are going.
bulkteleport-show-beam-r=Path red channel
bulkteleport-show-beam-g=Path green channel
bulkteleport-show-beam-b=Path blue channel
bulkteleport-show-beam-pretty=Display electric beams instead of dashed lines. These are prettier but over long distances may have a performance impact. Watch UPS.
bulkteleport-fluid-full=Due to Factorio fluid physics it can take a long time to fill fluid tanks the last little bit. This lowers the "full" line so teleportation triggers promptly. However, if you're pumping directly into fluid dematerializers and prefer round numbers this is safe to raise back to 1.0.
