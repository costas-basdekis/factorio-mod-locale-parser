[mod-setting-description]
early_biter_reduction=% level of reduction for biters in early game (0% evolution)
late_biter_reduction=% level of reduction for biters in late game (100% evolution)
early_ore_multiplier=multiplier to ore in newly discovered spawn location (when world at 0% apparent evolution*)
late_ore_multiplier=multiplier to ore in newly discovered spawn location (when world at 100% apparent evolution*)
late_ore_exponent=apparent evolution is (game evolution) ^ (evolution factor exponent). \nYou can experiment with values other than 1... for example at value 2 game evolution 50% will translate to 25% apparent evolution. (0.5^2=0.25). \n\nAfter some experimenting, I decided I don't know how to use it, to make game more balanced, but I left it implemented in code, so you can change it. \n\nWhen it is at 1, resource count of newly discovered spawn location grow linearly from "Early ore multiplier" to "Late ore multiplier" as evolution grows.. If you set it to 2, or (let's say) 5, resources will grow very, very slowly at early stages of evolution, so you can set late_ore_exponent to pretty high value, so players joining at high evolution level might get more starting resources (if they spawn has not been discovered yet)... Yeah, it's a bit overcomplicated. 
respawn-timer=How much time needs to pass (in seconds) before player can set spawn again.
custom_spawns=You can type custom spawns in this format : \n(name[x,y]) (use ";" as separator)\n\n(default : (Warsaw[2250,400]);(Paris[2040,434])\n\n*altnernative formatiing is like this :\nWarsaw,2250,400;Paris,2040,434;
research-help=If one team finishes research all other teams get this amount closer to finishing same research. (new progress=progress+((1-progress)*spying))
map-gen-scale=Map scaling factor, any positive scale is allowed. (default: 6, minimum: 0.01)
use-large-map=Whether the more detailed map data or not. Note that this will use more memory and your game will take longer to load. It will also scale up the map by 2 compared to the normal data. (default: false)
safe-zone-size=Size of the safe-zone in which water will be turned into sand so you will not instantly die when spawning on water. (default: 5)
repeat-map=Repeat the map so there are an infinite copies of earth. If disabled, everything beyond will be water.
