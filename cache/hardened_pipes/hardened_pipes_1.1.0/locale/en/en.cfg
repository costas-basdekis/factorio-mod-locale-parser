hardened_pipes=Hardened pipes

[mod-description]
hardened_pipes=Hardened pipes are expensive, and it requires some know-how to make them. However, they come with strong resistances and are ideal for use at the front-line. If biters or spitters always destroy the pipes that supply your flamethrower or waterthrower turrets, you should consider replacing them with hardened pipes!

PCHP-underground_distance=Maximum distance (hardened pipes-to-ground)
PCHP-easy_ratio=Use easy ratios?

[mod-setting-description]
PCHP-underground_distance=The value for maximum distance is equal to the number of empty tiles between two hardened underground pipes (default: 9, as for vanilla underground pipes).\nThe amount of ingredients required to make the hardened underground pipes is calculated with the formula "Base value * (maximum distance + 2)".
PCHP-easy_ratio=If true, the time needed to produce a pair of hardened underground pipes covering a maximum distance of X is the same needed to produce X hardened pipes. That way, one assembler of hardened pipes will always be sufficient to supply one assembler of hardened pipes-to-ground.\n(Allows for easier setups, but as the time needed to make a pair of hardened underground pipes will be extended, the overall number of assemblers needed to make the same amount will increase!)
