This minimalist mod stays close to the vanilla experience, adding only what's necessary to accomplish the goals.\n\nThe native life is capable of absorbing pollution. Destroying alien nests provides the red xenomass necessary to build pollution collectors. This gives a reason to go out and fight the aliens, something missing from the game after Alien Science was removed. In addition, turning pollution into electricity or oil products requires blue xenomass, acquired by killing alien creatures. Passive defenses are still an option, but with this mod, you're rewarded for investing in more complex systems.", "dependencies": ["base >= 0.18", "? Rampant"]}
