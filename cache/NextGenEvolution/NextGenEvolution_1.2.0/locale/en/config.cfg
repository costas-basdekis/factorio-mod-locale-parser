[mod-setting-description]
gogreen-spawner-absorb=Pollution absorbed evolution factor changes how much evolution increases with pollution absorbed by enemy spawners. Works the same as the map setting "Enemy > Evolution > Pollution factor". Pollution that reaches nests can be several times lower than pollution produced though, since trees and ground absorb most of the pollution before it reaches any nests (on default settings). To get similar evolution factors with a similar pollution cloud a number higher than the one you would otherwise use for "Pollution factor" is recommended if you set that to 0 and want use absorbed pollution instead. And you probably also want a very high "Destroy factor" to not make the best strategy to keep evolution down to be immediately killing all the spawners that touch the pollution cloud. Negative values are possible too.

gogreen-dying-tree-absorb=When trees are overwhelmed by pollution they take damage and absorb pollution. This factor changes how much pollution that is absorbed and damages trees will change evolution. Because natives that chew on the polluted fruits of nature get the dirt from your factory into their bodies.

gogreen-nature-absorb=Trees can absorb pollution without taking damage if the pollution amount is low enough. Trees actually need CO2 to live, so it makes sense that this factor doesn't really increase pollution. So the suggested value here is a negative value so evolution is slightly decreased as long as the pollution isn't too strong.

gogreen-nature-killed=This factor changes how much evolution increases when you kill trees. If you have set pollution that damages trees to increase evolution then it is suggested that you also set a value here to discourage killing off trees with your axe which would otherwise stop evolution from damaging pollution.

gogreen-natives-killed=If you want spitters and biters that are killed to increase evolution, here's the setting. A recommended value is maybe 100 times lower than spawner killed factor (Map gen settings > Enemy > Evolution).
