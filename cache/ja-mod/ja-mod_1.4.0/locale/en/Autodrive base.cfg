autodrive=Autodrive

[mod-description]
autodrive=Car equipment for train avoidance, player following, logistic network integration, circuit network connectivity, fuel refill, ammo reload, radio control, enemy targeting, and gate control. Requires a vehicle grid mod.

[item-name]
autodrive-control=Car radio control

[item-description]
autodrive-control=Drag to select one or more cars. Click to dispatch selected cars to a location.

autodrive-train-sensor=Train sensor
autodrive-enemy-sensor=Enemy sensor
autodrive-fuel-sensor=Fuel sensor
autodrive-ammo-sensor=Ammo sensor
autodrive-gate-sensor=Gate sensor
autodrive-logistic-sensor=Logistic network sensor
autodrive-circuit-sensor=Circuit network sensor (Shortwave)
autodrive-follow-sensor=Follow player sensor

[equipment-description]
autodrive-train-sensor=Car will sense a nearby moving train and brake automatically, or accelerate hard if already crossing rails. Does nothing if you're driving along rails!
autodrive-enemy-sensor=Car will sense and target nearby enemies within range of its guns. Does nothing if vehicle is unarmed.
autodrive-fuel-sensor=Car will refuel from its inventory.
autodrive-ammo-sensor=Car will reload ammunition from its inventory.
autodrive-gate-sensor=Car will open gates without a driver. Enables path finding through gates.
autodrive-logistic-sensor=Car will interact with the logistic network when parked. Filtered trunk slots are refilled like a requester chest, and unfiltered slots are exported like an active provider chest.
autodrive-circuit-sensor=Car will interact with the circuit network via a Shortwave channel. Use the radio control to select a car and a radio to associate the two. Send X and Y signals to the shortwave channel to direct the car.
autodrive-follow-sensor=Car will follow a player.
