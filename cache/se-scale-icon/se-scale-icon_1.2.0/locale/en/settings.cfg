ssi-hide-launch-pad-combinator=Hides the alt-mode combinator output on launch pads (shows rocket fuel, cargo sections, space capsule and ready signal).
ssi-hide-launch-pad-tank=Hides the alt-mode rocket fuel icon on launch pads.
ssi-override-requester-paste-multiplier=Changes the requester paste multiplier from default (amount of resources needed to keep crafting for 30 seconds) to the value specified below. The multiplier will only be set for building recipes which doesn't already have one set by Space Exploration mod.
ssi-override-requester-paste-multiplier-value=Setting a value of 1 means that the request should be able to keep crafting for 1 second, so if you add speed modules it will request more if the building can be crafted in less than 1 second. Setting a value of 0 will request enough materials for one crafting cycle, regardless of crafting speed.
