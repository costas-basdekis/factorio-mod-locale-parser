[technology-description]
voltage-electric-trains=Higher powered trains that run off of electric batteries.
voltage-wireless-energy-distribution=A powerful charging system that will charge items within player and vehicle grids nearby at different rates depending on the charging pole tier used. 50% of the power is wasted due to inefficiency. Power AVERAGES OUT to the rates mentioned, but is transmitted through large rapid spikes rather than continuously.
