[item-name]
Schall-radiological-warfare=Radiological warfare
Schall-dirty-bomb=Dirty bomb
Schall-decontamination-capsule=Decontamination capsule

[item-description]
Schall-dirty-bomb=Slow but very long-lasting pollution and damage to the area.
Schall-decontamination-capsule=Clean up entities (e.g., player character) and land, removing effects from __ENTITY__poison-cloud__ and __ENTITY__Schall-radioactive-contamination__.

[entity-name]
Schall-radioactive-waste-incinerator=Radioactive waste incinerator
Schall-radioactive-contamination=Radioactive contamination

[entity-description]
Schall-radioactive-waste-incinerator=Wastes are incinerated and released into nature, as pollutants.

[recipe-name]
Schall-incineration-template=Incineration - __1__
Schall-dirty-bomb-alternate-template=__ITEM__Schall-dirty-bomb__ - __1__

[recipe-description]
Schall-dirty-bomb-alternate-template=Alternate recipe.\nMade from __1__ instead.

[technology-name]
Schall-radiological-warfare=__ITEM__Schall-radiological-warfare__

[technology-description]
Schall-radiological-warfare=Deliberately releasing the radioactive waste to attack.  Until the contamination is cleaned, its long-lasting effect denies access to the area.

[mod-setting-name]
Schall-RWS-incineration-time-base=Base time of incinerations (3)
Schall-RWS-incineration-emissions-base=Base emissions of incinerations (30)
Schall-RWS-radiological-warfare-enable=Enable __ITEM__Schall-radiological-warfare__
Schall-RWS-radioactive-contamination-emissions=Emissions __ENTITY__Schall-radioactive-contamination__ (0.05)
Schall-RWS-radioactive-atomic-rocket-enable=Enable radioactive __ITEM__atomic-bomb__

[mod-setting-description]
Schall-RWS-incineration-time-base=In units of seconds.
Schall-RWS-incineration-emissions-base=In units of per minute.
Schall-RWS-radiological-warfare-enable=EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE!\nStill subject to big changes, due to balancing and practicality.\nAdds __ITEM__Schall-dirty-bomb__ and __ITEM__Schall-decontamination-capsule__.\nAllows mods to add radioactive effects to projectiles.
Schall-RWS-radioactive-contamination-emissions=In units of per second.\nEmitted by __ITEM__Schall-dirty-bomb__.
Schall-RWS-radioactive-atomic-rocket-enable=Real-world nuclear bombs unleash immense radioactive contamination around ground zero.  Factorio ones are really too "clean" in comparison.\nRequires __ITEM__Schall-radiological-warfare__ enabled.\nOn: (Default) Adds such effects to the vanilla __ITEM__atomic-bomb__.  (Internally, it is done to projectile "atomic-rocket".)\nOff: Vanilla setting, no changes made.

[mod-name]
SchallRadioactiveWaste=Schall Radioactive Waste

[mod-description]
SchallRadioactiveWaste=Provides different ways to handle the nuclear wastes (e.g., U-238) that are often in excess stockpiles.\nAdds an incinerator, which is particularly useful for peaceful mode.  Combat-addicted players can also use it to intentionally raise the pollution level (evolution factor) quickly!\nAdds radiological warfare (optional), which is the more “evil” way to make use of the waste.  Includes dirty bomb, decontamination capsule.
