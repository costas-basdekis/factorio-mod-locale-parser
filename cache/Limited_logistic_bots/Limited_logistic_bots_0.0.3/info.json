This mod add squared power consumption onto roboports for each active logistic bots in a logistic network (roboports need more power to command bots with all the electromagnetic noise !). This mean the more logistic bots active in a group, the more extra power they use. This mod was meant to nerf heavy concentrated logistic bot usage. Please note that if you over-saturate a logistic network with bots, they won't be able to function and will use maximum power.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "homepage": "none"}
