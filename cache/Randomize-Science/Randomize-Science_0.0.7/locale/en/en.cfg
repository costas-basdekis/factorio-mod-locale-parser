[mod-setting-description]
Randomize-Science-random-seed=Seed used to generate recipes. Should result in the same recipes if all flags are kept the same.
Randomize-Science-replace-science=The whole mod. Without this you can only grab your Lock String and everything else is Vanilla science recipes.
Randomize-Science-allow-fluid=Allows fluids as science pack ingredients.
Randomize-Science-allow-raw=Allows 'Tier 0' the raw ores, coal, stone, and if desired wood/fish to be science pack ingredients.
Randomize-Science-allow-wood=Allows wood or wood-based ingredients in science pack recipes. Having access to a lot of wood through mods might be necessary if Allow Raw is also checked.
Randomize-Science-allow-category=Allows the entity that each science pack is crafted in to be randomized. Smelting is possible if there is only 1 ingredient.
Randomize-Science-require-science-pack=Requires 1 science pack from previous tier as one of the ingredients in next science pack recipe. Helps smooth uneven balance.
Randomize-Science-max-ingredients=Maximum number of different ingredients in each randomized recipe. Includes Science Packs toward max if checked. Prioritizes Min Ingredients value.
Randomize-Science-min-ingredients=Minimum number of different ingredients in each randomized recipe. Includes Science Packs toward min if checked.
Randomize-Science-lower-floor=Expand lower cap on ingredient pools by this many tiers. Can make later recipes easier. There are about 2 tiers for each science level. Negative values will use random from 0 to positive value.
Randomize-Science-raise-ceiling=Expand upper cap on ingredient pools by this many tiers. Can make any recipe impossible without mods. There are about 2 tiers for each science level but they are already at the cap of what is normally possible. Negative values will use random from 0 to positive value.
Randomize-Science-allow-fish=Allows fish if Allow Raw is checked. Having access to a lot of fish through mods might be necessary.
Randomize-Science-balance-big-ingredients=Remove ingredients that are too expensive from the pool, tuned by difficulty multiplier.
Randomize-Science-balance-difficulty=Total raw value of ingredients compared to vanilla multiplier. Can use 0.01 to 100. Negative values will use random from 1 to positive integer value.
Randomize-Science-outputs=Method for determining number of packs produced and crafting time for each recipe.
Randomize-Science-balance-inputs=Further balance the output ratio based on the ingredients. Uses Ratio setting as base but makes adjustments to number of results or craft time from there.
Randomize-Science-order=Which order should the higher ingredient tiers be placed? Ingredients unlocked by eariler tier can be required for later tier.
