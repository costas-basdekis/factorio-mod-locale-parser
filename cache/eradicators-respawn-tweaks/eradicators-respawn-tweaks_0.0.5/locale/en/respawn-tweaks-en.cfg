er-respawn-delay=How many milliseconds it takes to respawn. \nDefault: 5000 milliseconds\n\nTechnical: Value will be rounded to fit tick-resolution on next death.
er-respawn-scan-radius=How close you have to be to a valid respawn location. If no locations are in range you respawn at the landing site like always.\nDefault: 1000 meters\n\nTechnical: This setting affects how much performance it costs to find a valid location. Has no effect during normal gameplay.
er-respawn-target=What kind of thing you want to respawn next to.\nDefault: Car\nOther good values: Radar, Rocket Silo,...\n\nTechnical: This is a class of prototypes, i.e. all cars, all radars, etc.. Invalid values will be overwritten on your next death. Be careful to chose a non-common type. For performance reasons the scan will prematurely abort if too many objects are found.
