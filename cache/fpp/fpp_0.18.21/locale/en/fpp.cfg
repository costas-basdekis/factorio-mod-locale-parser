[mod-setting-description]
fpp_less_module_slots=Less module slots in higher upgrades. Especially in higher tiers, many automation machines and miners have a lot of module slots in an imbalanced way. Check this box to keep it more "normal".
fpp_upgrade_tiers=The maximum possible upgrade tier (1 to 14). 6 or 13 is not recommended.
fpp_upgrade_colors=Style of colorizing higher upgrade tiers of devices and machines.
fpp_upgrade_icons=Select the set of icons for upgraded devices. Roman == roman numbers. Standard == Color-layed icons. None == All icons are the same.
fpp_mixed_ores_amount=Choice for variety of mixed ores. Either for keeping it simple with less different mixed ores or keep the game hard with many different mixed ores. Insane++ will additionally remove all vanilla ressources.
fpp_colors_amount=Choice for variety of colors possible.
fpp_aliens=Make the fights with aliens in later game more interesting. Be careful; the option "legion" could be frustrating at later game stage.
fpp_logistics_amount=Additional logistic entities for more variation, like more different chests or more belts.
fpp_difficult_start=Check this box for additional research required on start. This stretches the early phase of game.
fpp_upgradestone_synthesis=Players are not forced anymore to search for blackstones and essencestones on surface, they are both syntheticable (Upgrade tiers 6 and 8).
fpp_enable_productivity=Settings for the possibility of productivity modules. This is only related to FPP-recipes and wonÂ´t touch vanilla recipes in any way.
