[mod-setting-description]
laziest-bastard-assembler-3=(1-20) Number of Assembler-3's.\nYou must have at least one to achieve true laziness.
laziest-bastard-assembler-2=(0-20) Number of Assembler-2's.\nNot necessary, but if you're lazier than most they're nice to have.
laziest-bastard-assembler-1=(0-20) Number of Assembler-1's.\nNot necessary, but if you're lazier than most they're nice to have.
laziest-bastard-power=Starting Power Option.\n- Steam: Start with Steam Engines, Boilers, and an Offshore Pump.\n- Solar: Start with Solar Panels.\n- Solar/Accumulator: Start with Solar Panels and Accumulators.
laziest-bastard-power-number=(1-20) How many of each power generator.\nNote: Supplementary items will be supplied in lesser but sufficient numbers.
laziest-bastard-power-poles=(1-20) Starting Electric Poles
