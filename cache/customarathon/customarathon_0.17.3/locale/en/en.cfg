[mod-setting-description]
customarathon-ingredients=Predefined ingredients will be more expensive in all the recipes. Has vanilla and mod support.\nSet to 1 to ignore.\n\n(Minimum=0.1; Maximum=10; Default=1)
customarathon-circuits=Includes circuits in the expensive ingredients. It will have a cascading effect with regular ingredients.
customarathon-usables=All entities and items with use will be affected. Expensive machines will make expansion more meaningful and overall increase the value of optimal builds.\nSet to 1 to ignore.\n\n(Minimum=0.1; Maximum=20; Default=2)
customarathon-tiers=Exponentially raises the cost of higher tier machines and equipment. A great way to scale the production up even for the mall. The multiplier is very sensitive as it uses exponential function.\nSet to 1 to ignore.\n\n(Minimum=0.5; Maximum=2; Default=1)
customarathon-successive=Works for item types such as belts, inserters, modules, but not assemblers. Twice as many of that item type will be required for the next tier.
customarathon-crafting-time=Crafting time multiplier for machines and equipment.\nSet to 1 to ignore.\n\n(Minimum=0.1; Maximum=10; Default=1)
customarathon-modules=Add modules to the machine/equipment expensive list
customarathon-ammos=Add ammos to the machine/equipment expensive list
customarathon-new-items=To counteract expensive machines, this option essentially offers new dummy items. The recipes will use the standard costs, making science unaffected by most of the previous settings.\nSafe warning: loading time can be significantly longer.
