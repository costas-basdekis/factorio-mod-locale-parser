[mod-setting-description]
ToxicForest-generation-mode=Controls how forests are generated and placed on the map.\n\n[font=default-bold]Autoplace[/font]: uses Factorio's built in generation system, supplemented to ensure complete coverage.\n[font=default-bold]Autoplace Optimized[/font]: disables ToxicForest's more CPU intensive functions; ore patches may spawn uncovered and small gaps may appear in trees, but this mode is by far the fastest.\n[font=default-bold]Post-Generation[/font]: requires more CPU and places trees after chunk generation has completed. This mode can be unpredictable about which trees get placed.
ToxicForest-density=Density of tree placements. For example, a value of 0.1 is 10% tree coverage in mode 3. Autoplace modes require lower values to have noticeable impact (eg, 0.05 generates a medium density forest).
ToxicForest-influence-boost=Universal boost to all influence values.
ToxicForest-max-probability=Controls tree density within a forest. Lowering this value will result in less dense forests.
ToxicForest-random-penalty=Random penalty applied to the Max Random Probability value.
ToxicForest-use-min-influence=Nothing can modify influence below this value. Most direct impact in ensuring trees can spawn everywhere.
ToxicForest-min-influence=Nothing can modify influence below this value.
ToxicForest-min-influence-random=Randomizes influence to provide a different experience on each map generation.
ToxicForest-clear-starting-area=This option reduces tree frequency within the starting area.
ToxicForest-clear-radius=Radius of trees to clear. 4~256. Vanilla is 128 with a 64 tile transition.
ToxicForest-clear-resource-patches=Prevents trees from covering resource patches. This only affects newly generated chunks.\nNote: Factorio has a natural bias against trees over resources. Turning this off does not guarantee trees over resources in Autoplace Optimized mode.
