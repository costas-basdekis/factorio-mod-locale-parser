Thanks to vralfy and his 1000 sounds to die for mod as I stole your mod and changed all the sound file names to lego yoda, because 3 hours of failing to code on my own was too much for me.  I haven't extensively tested this mod so let me know if there's something wrong with it or simply make your own lego yoda mod, you'll probably do a better job than I could ever do...  Finally figured out how to make it not crash the game anymore."}
