[item-description]
cut-and-paste-blueprint-cut=This is the result of a selection made with the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-cut__. This will be automatically transformed into a __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-cut__ when placed in inventory or hand.
cut-and-paste-blueprint-copy=This is the result of a selection made with the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-copy__.
cut-and-paste-tool-cut=Select an area to cut with __CONTROL__select-for-blueprint__ then place it where you want it moved with __CONTROL__build__.\n\nUse __CONTROL__select-for-cancel-deconstruct__ to include tiles when selecting.\n\nUse __CONTROL__build-ghost__ when placing to remove all colliding entities.
cut-and-paste-tool-copy=Select an area to copy with __CONTROL__select-for-blueprint__ then place it where you want it copied with __CONTROL__build__.\n\nUse __CONTROL__select-for-cancel-deconstruct__ to include tiles when selecting.\n\nUse __CONTROL__build-ghost__ when placing to remove all colliding entities.

[mod-setting-description]
cut-and-paste-replace-mode=Specify what to do with conflicting entities when pasting a copy/cut blueprint.\n\nWhen different:\nRecreate destination entity if it has a different type than the source.\nWhen the entities are identical, the destination entity's settings and direction will be copied from source if possible (else it will be deconstructed and replaced). Circuit wires will be kept.\n\nAlways:\nConflicting entities are always desconstructed even if they are of the same type. The original circuit wires will also be recreated if both entities are of the same type.\n\nNever: conflicting entities are never deconstructed (this doesn't apply to trees which are always deconstructed by the game when force-placing blueprints).
cut-and-paste-reuse-copy-blueprint=If enabled, you'll be able to reuse the blueprint generated by the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-copy__. These blueprints differ from vanilla blueprints in the way colliding items get replaced when force-placing them.\n\nWhen this is disabled they can only be used when in the player's hand and are automatically converted back to their original tool form when stored in inventory.
cut-and-paste-reconnect-wires=If enabled, circuit connections from outside the cut selection will be relinked to the pasted entities if they're not too far.
cut-and-paste-keep-tiles=If enabled, the tiles selected with the __ITEM__cut-and-paste-tool-cut__ will only be copied to the destination, not moved.
cut-and-paste-copy-items=If enabled, items in containers (chest contents, turret ammo, furnace fuel, ...) will be also be copied to the destination. Modules are always copied regardless of this setting.
