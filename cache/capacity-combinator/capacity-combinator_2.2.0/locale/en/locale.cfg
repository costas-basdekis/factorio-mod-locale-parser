[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
capacity-combinator=This combinator type outputs accumulator capacity statistics of an electric network in joules as signals to the connected combinator networks.\nFollowing unique signals for the connected electric network are provided:\n [virtual-signal=power-factor]: internal prescaling factor X as [font=default-bold]user combinator setting[/font] for each Power Combinator for all values sent to the combinator network\n [virtual-signal=power-capacity]: current accumulator capacity (J)\n [virtual-signal=power-max-capacity]: maximal accumulator capacity (J)\n\nIf the output values are over the scale of 2³¹ then the combinator output doesn't update the stats and the indicator light in right bottom corner will show red. In this case please set the scaling factor to a reasonable value.
