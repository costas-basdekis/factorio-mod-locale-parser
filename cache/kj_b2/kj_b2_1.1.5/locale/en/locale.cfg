aircraft-landing-speed-kj_b2=Speed to land, no longer airborne and has collision with other objects (Should be less than the takeoff speed)
aircraft-takeoff-speed-kj_b2=Speed to takeoff and be airborne, no longer colliding with anything (Should be greater than the landing speed)
kj_b2no_melee_damage=Standard ist ON. Only damage of the type "flak" will deal damage to the plane.
kj_b2_crash_boom=If the plane crashes or gets shot down while atomic bombs are in the bomb bay, it will explode atomically in 35% of the cases :D
