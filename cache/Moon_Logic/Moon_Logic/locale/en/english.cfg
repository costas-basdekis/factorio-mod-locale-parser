[mod-setting-description]
red-wire-name=Lua environment name for in-game "red" circuit network values.\nChanges all labels in the GUIs as well.
green-wire-name=Lua environment name for in-game "green" circuit network values.\nChanges all labels in the GUIs as well.
gui-signals-update-interval=Interval in game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second at 1x game speed) between updating signal table in GUI.\nOnly relevant when combinator code/signals GUI window is actually open.\nHigher values will give better performance, but you might not notice some signals flapping on/off there, if they do that in-between updates. Default is 1, i.e. update on every tick.
gui-textbox-edit-history=If enabled, undo/redo buttons on top of the window will track every single change to combinator code.\nIf disabled, these buttons will only track history between saved code.\nDisabling this makes editing code way more smooth and pleasant, at the cost of those small undo/redo features.
