ftl-science-pack=Obtained by launching Faster than Light research satellites. Used to research the FTL drive.
ftl-research-satellite=Launch into space to obtain Faster than Light science packs

[item-name]
ftl-science-pack=Faster than Light science pack
ftl-research-satellite=Faster than Light research satellite

[mod-setting-name]
improved-ftl-cost=Technology cost
improved-ftl-space=FTL propulsion requires space science

[mod-setting-description]
improved-ftl-cost=Changes the amount of science packs required for the two Faster than Light technologies. Note that you need to launch rockets to obtain the science packs.
improved-ftl-space=Toggles whether the final research stage requires space science packs *in addition to* the new FTL research packs. Effectively doubles the amount of rockets you will need.

[technology-description]
ftl-theory-A=Theoretical faster than light travel. Unlocks research towards practical Faster than Light technology. In space!

[technology-name]
ftl-theory-A=Faster than Light theory
