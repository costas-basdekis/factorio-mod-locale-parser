distribution-centers=[item=sdc-dc-small] Distribution Centers
distribution-centers-title=Distribution Centers
distribution-centers-paragraph=Distribution Centers are buildings capable to move items between adjacent inventories: they will be check each inventory one by one and by applying circuit signals to these inventories one can control what, how many and how to move items.
storage=[virtual-signal=signal-S] Storage
storage-title=Storage
storage-paragraph=By applying circuit signal [virtual-signal=signal-S] to inventories one can designate inventories to take items from by Distribution Centers. A Distribution Center itself has inventory and can be designated as Storage. Logistics chests can be designated as storages too.
consolidated-loading=[virtual-signal=signal-C] Consolidated Loading
consolidated-loading-title=Consolidated Loading
consolidated-loading-paragraph=When positive [virtual-signal=signal-C] circuit signal is applied to an inventory, a Distribution Center will check if the following conditions are met:\n * The inventory is empty.\n * There are items not less than value read from the signal in the Storages.\nIf succeed, the Distribution Center will move exact amount of items, otherwise it will move no items at all.

consolidated-loading-paragraph-1=Consolidated Loading can be additionally configured by the following circuit signals:\n * [virtual-signal=signal-T] [font=default-bold]Time Occupied:[/font] normally a Distribution Center tries to load items every second (60 ticks), however with this setting a Distribution Center will wait [virtual-signal=signal-T] ticks (divided by 60 and rounded up, but not less than 1) between loads.\n\n * [virtual-signal=signal-X] [font=default-bold]Target:[/font] with this setting when an inventory has positive [virtual-signal=signal-X] and any item negative signals, a Distribution Center will only load items if it has less than the negative item signal stored.

constant-combinators=[item=constant-combinator] Constant Combinators
constant-combinators-title=Constant Combinators
constant-combinators-paragraph=When copying settings from one Constant Combinator to another, the target Combinator will try to read recipe from neighbour crafting machine if any and set it's own signals to the required ingredients with respect to loading settings signals.
regular-loading=[virtual-signal=signal-R] Regular Loading
regular-loading-title=Regular Loading
regular-loading-paragraph=Unlike Consolidated Loading, when in Regular mode a Distribution Center will try to load items always with one exception: items failed to be load to inventories in Consolidated mode count as "reserved" and will be ignored. The mode is set by positive [virtual-signal=signal-R] signal. When multiple inventories are in one network and have the signal, a Distribution Center will treat them like one and split loaded items evenly.
regular-loading-blueprint=[font=default-bold]Regular Loading example [special-item][/font]
regular-loading-paragraph-1=With combination of [virtual-signal=signal-N] signal, a Distribution Center instead of reading circuit signals to determine what items to load, will try to read "requests" generated from reserved items by another Distribution Center connected to the inventory by circuit network. Distribution Centers will do "retranslate" these requests, making possible to build their own network.

holding-items=[item=iron-chest] Holding Items
holding-items-title=Holding Items
holding-items-paragraph=Non adjacent (corner) to a Distibution Center inventory will force it to reserve items determined by according circuit signals, thus preventing the items to be loaded when in Regular mode and to be requested from other Distribution Centers.
