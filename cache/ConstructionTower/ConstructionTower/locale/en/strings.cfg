	ct-better-robot-battery=Enables the technology to improve the battery of the robots. Needed to reach the corners of the Construction Towers construction area. (Default: Enabled)
	ct-drone-charging-station-robot-slots-count=Amount of slots for robots to be stored inside the Drone Charging Station (Default: 0)
	ct-construction-tower-robot-slots-count=Amount of slots for robots to be stored inside the Construction Tower (Default: 0)
	ct-drone-charging-station-logistic-radius=Radius of the Logistic Network for the Drone Charging Station. If the value is bigger than 75, robots may not be able to reach the next station, without researching a better battery for the robots (Default: 18)
	ct-construction-tower-logistic-radius=Radius of the Logistic Network for the Construction Tower. If the value is bigger than 75, robots may not be able to reach the next station, without researching a better battery for the robots (Default: 18)
