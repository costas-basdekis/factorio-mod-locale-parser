[item-description]
max-combinator=Returns the signal with the highest value.
min-combinator=Returns the signal with the lowest value.
rand-combinator=Returns randomly one of the signals.

avg-combinator=Average is computed by adding up all the values and dividing that score by the number of values (rounded down)
med-combinator=The Median is the number found at the exact middle of the set of values (or in case of even number of signals, take the mean/average of the two middle values rounded down)
cnt-combinator=Number of (red or green) signals
sum-combinator=Amount of values of (red or green) signals
dif-combinator=Signals which are only in red OR green will be kept. Signals which are in both circuits will be removed.
int-combinator=Signals which are in both circuits will be kept and added.
math-allInOne=Co-Processor will output a distinct or a set of signals depending on its function (default 'Maximum'). It needs to be placed adjacent to an electric pole. Antenna away from the pole. Default update interval 1/sec.

[technology-description]
math-combinators=Unlock coprocessors for math operations and set theory.

math-tooltip="Red circuit is preferred. If red circuit is not connected the green circuit is used. If both circuits are needed combine the circuits with an arithmetic combinator and its EACH function first."
