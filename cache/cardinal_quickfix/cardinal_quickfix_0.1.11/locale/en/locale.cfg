[mod-setting-description]
cardinal-enable=Turn Cardinal on or off.
cardinal-speed-differential=Enable speed-sensitive correction rate. Turning this on will reduce the correction rate at lower speeds, to allow for precision movement.
cardinal-correction-area=The percentage of the "area" between two snap angles that will actively attempt to correct the vehicle's heading during movement.
cardinal-snap-angles=The number of angles to gently snap to when driving a vehicle. Multiples of 4 recommended, setting to zero will have no effect. (0-256).
cardinal-correction-rate=The rate at which the cardinal system adjusts the heading to suit the snap angles, higher values will perform more aggressive correction. (0-100)
cardinal-limit-rotation-speed=Limit the correction rotation speed to the maximum turning speed of the vehicle.
