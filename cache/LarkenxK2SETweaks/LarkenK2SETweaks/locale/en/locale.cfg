# allow-k2-liquid-tanks-on-spaceship=Enable K2 50k and 200k Storage Tanks to be placed on spaceships.
allow-long-space-underground-belt=Make Space Underground Belts have the same max distance as express belts. Only enabled if long underground belts in K2 settings are also enabled.
# allow-long-underground-space-pipe=Make Space Underground Pipes have increased max underground distance.
space-pipe-underground-distance=Set the max length of underground space pipes. SE Default is 6, K2 Steel Pipe Undergrounds are 20.
allow-upgrade-singularity-lab=Upgrade the Singularity Lab to have 15 base research speed (1.5x more than space lab).
allow-remove-tesseract-from-stabilizer=Remove the Naquium Tesseract from K2 Stabilizer Recipe.
# allow-tweak-matter-ratios=Tweak matter conversion cube ratio nerfs from SE for K2 Matter Assembler (default is 50% effectiveness).
# allow-lossless-matter-cube=Allow matter cube ratio changes. Default enables 1:1 matter conversion/deconversion effectiveness.
matter-cube-cost=The amount of matter required to create a matter cube. Space Exploration makes this 2,000 while in K2 it is a lossless conversion ratio for matter cubes (1k -> 1k.)
matter-cube-density=The amount of matter a matter cube contains and yields when deconverted to back to matter.

allow-stabilizer-less-likely-to-break=Makes K2 Matter Stabilizers 99.5% likely to be preserved versus 99%.
matter-reconversion-ratio=Change the matter deconversion ratios for K2+Vanilla ores. In K2, these ratios are lossless (1:1). Space Exploration nerfs this and makes deconversion 50% as effective (2:1). Recommended to make this still balanced for SE by nerfing K2 ratios, but making the ratio 1.25:1.
se-ore-matter-reconversion-ratio=Change the matter deconversion ratios for Space Exploration ores. By default, these ratios range from a ~16:1 deconversion ratio to some as steep as 100:1 while also requiring charged stabilizers to produce.
allow-hypercooler-on-spaceship=Allow a hypercooler to be placed on spaceships. Also enables some thermofluids production on grounded radiators and particle accelerators.
allow-matter-buildings-in-space=Allow K2 Matter Processing buildings in space (not recommended, unbalanced).
allow-remove-stabilizer-for-vulcanite=Remove charged stabilizer from vulcanite matter deconversion recipe since core mining enables vulcanite on Nauvis anyway.
allow-se-ore-matter-changes=Enable Space Exploration Matter Processing Matter Value & Ratio Changes. By default, SE ores are quite expensive to deconvert from matter and the ratios for converting from matter are not consistent (exponential in some cases). This change enables you to override the ratio to a constant value below so that the matter value is always fixed to the deconversion value.
