runspeeedtoggle-speed1=This is expected to be the smallest modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).
runspeeedtoggle-speed2=This is expected to be the middle speed modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).
runspeeedtoggle-speed3=This is expected to be the largest modifier. 0 is the unmodified running speed. Negative numbers slow the player down by that fraction. Positive numbers multiply the speed by 1 + number (i.e. 0.3 means 30% faster).
