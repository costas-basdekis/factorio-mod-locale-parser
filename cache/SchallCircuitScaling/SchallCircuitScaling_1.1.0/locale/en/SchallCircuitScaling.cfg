[technology-name]
Schall-circuit-miniaturization=Circuit miniaturization

[technology-description]
Schall-circuit-miniaturization=Circuit components are shrinked into sub-tile sizes, allowing one to use less area with the same set of calculations.

circuitscaling-tier-circuit-compenent=Lowest tier Circuit components

[mod-setting-description]
circuitscaling-tier-circuit-compenent=1: Down to tier -1, which is 1/2 in linear size (1/4 in area) of their vanilla counterparts.\n2: Down to tier -2, which is 1/4 in linear size (1/16 in area) of their vanilla counterparts.\n3: Down to tier -3, which is 1/8 in linear size (1/64 in area) of their vanilla counterparts.

[mod-name]
SchallCircuitScaling=Schall Circuit Scaling

[mod-description]
SchallCircuitScaling=Adds scaled down versions in different sizes for various circuit components.  With these mini- and micro-sized (sub-tile) components, circuit designs can be made much more compact.  It is also possible to construct dot matrix lamp display with finer “pixels”, offering higher resolution!\nWorks best with “Schall Lamp Contrast” mod.\nIncludes lamp, arithmetic combinator, decider combinator, constant combinator.
