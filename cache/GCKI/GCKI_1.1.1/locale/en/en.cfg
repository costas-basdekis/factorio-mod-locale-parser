[mod-setting-description]
GCKI-debug_in_game=Should debug messages of this mod be shown in the game?\n(Unless you're debugging this mod, you probably won't need to turn this on.)
;Added debug_in_log (0.17.8)
GCKI-debug_in_log=Should debug messages of this mod be written to factorio-current.log?\n(Usually there's no need to clutter up your logfile, but if you run into problems with this mod, please turn this on and include the output in your bug report!)
GCKI-long_reach=Usually, you can only place your vehicle in the vicinity of your character (default game settings: radius of 10 tiles). If you have mods installed that extend your reach, check this option to be able to place your vehicle farther away.\n (WARNING: If you have any mod that extends your reach very far, this will allow you to teleport your character to distant locations if it is inside the vehicle. It is recommended to not activate this option!)
GCKI-render_text=If active, a message will be left for you on the spot where your vehicle was just before somebody stole or destroyed it. The message will be visible only to you.
GCKI-render_time=Set the time (in seconds) after which messages about destroyed/stolen vehicles are removed again.\n(Allowed values: 1-3600; default: 300)
;Added GCKI-render_color (0.17.8). Changed typo at end of string        : "))" --> ".)" (0.17.10)
GCKI-render_color=Set the color of messages about destroyed/stolen vehicles.\n(These messages can only be seen by one player, so messages for other players don't get into the way and you can use the color that suits you best.)
;Added teleport_to_other_surface (0.17.9, will be used in 0.17.10)
GCKI-teleport_to_other_surface=If you're in a vehicle owned by somebody else, the owner may summon the vehicle and everything inside just about anywhere at any time. Usually you will be summoned along with the vehicle. However, if this option is not active, you will be ejected from the vehicle before it is moved to another surface (e.g. a Factorissimo building).
;Added GCKI-zahnfeechen_icons (0.17.10)
GCKI-zahnfeechen_icons=Are you used to the keys from "Gizmos Car Keys - Zahnfeechen Patch"? Then you can replace the default icons here!\n(This option changes just the icons, nothing else!)
