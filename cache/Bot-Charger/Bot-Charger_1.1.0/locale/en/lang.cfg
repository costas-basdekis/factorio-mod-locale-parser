eus-cfg=Charging power per robot in MV (read desc)
[mod-setting-description]
eus-cfg=In here put values as you wish value 100 will result in 100/100 = 1MW min consumption(actively consuming power from network if values is 100 the buffer is 100 too so the roboport will store 100MW and if value is 100 once again then it will have  100*charging sports(base game 4) so in the end it will be 400MW maximum consumption. Hope this helped!
