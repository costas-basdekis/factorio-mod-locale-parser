chunkychunks-follow-alt-mode=Sync ChunkyChunks mode with ALT mode (entity info) when it is changed.

chunkychunks-enabled-1=Grid 1 is either Disabled, Always enabled or enabled when ALT-mode is enabled.
chunkychunks-size-1=Size of grid #1 in tiles. Two values separated by a space gives you control of width and height independently. Factorio chunks are 32 tiles. Substation: 18. Big pole: 30. Roboport logistics/construction: 50/110. Radar active/scanning: 224 (7 chunks)/928 (29 chunks).
chunkychunks-offset-1=Offset of grid #1. Two values separated by a space gives you control of X and Y offset independently.
chunkychunks-spacing-1=Spacing of grid #1. Two values separated by a space gives you control of X and Y spacing independently. This allows you to make squares that are spaced this value away from where the line would otherwise be. Negative values gives you crosses (+) of the chosen size instead.
chunkychunks-color-1=Empty means same as player colour. Set red, green, blue and alpha components as values from 0 to 1 separated by a space. Alpha is optional and defaults to 1. Example: "1 0 0" is red (don't include "").
chunkychunks-centre-mark-1=Grid 1 centre marking, helps you find the centre of your grids. Marking size depends on grid size.

chunkychunks-enabled-2=Grid 2 is either Disabled, Always enabled or enabled when ALT-mode is enabled.
chunkychunks-size-2=Size of grid #2 in tiles. Two values separated by a space gives you control of width and height independently. Factorio chunks are 32 tiles. Substation: 18. Big pole: 30. Roboport logistics/construction: 50/110. Radar active/scanning: 224 (7 chunks)/928 (29 chunks).

chunkychunks-size-3=Size of grid #3 in tiles. Two values separated by a space gives you control of width and height independently. Factorio chunks are 32 tiles. Substation: 18. Big pole: 30. Roboport logistics/construction: 50/110. Radar active/scanning: 224 (7 chunks)/928 (29 chunks).
