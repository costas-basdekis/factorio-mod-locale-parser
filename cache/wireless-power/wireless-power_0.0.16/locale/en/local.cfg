[mod-setting-description]
wp-config-efficiency-desc=Normal efficiency will impose a large percentage cost to power transferred over each tesseract. High-Efficiency halves that cost. Perfect removes all percentage costs. Warning: Perfect will greatly reduce the benefit of advancing to the higher tiers of Tesseract.
wp-config-personal-efficiency-desc=Normal efficiency will impose a huge percentage cost to the power grid to use. High-Efficiency halves that cost.
wp-config-drain-desc=Enables the global power drain incurred for having at least one Tesseract placed of a given tier. The drain starts at 1MW and is multiplied by 5 for each tier of Tesseract that is placed. eg, having any Tesseract MK2s costs 5 MW and having any Tesseract MK3s costs 25. If disabled, higher tiers of Tesseract have no downside to use besides the cost of materials.
wp-config-warmup-desc=Enables the warmup phase where each new tesseract placed on the map requires a certain amount of power before it becomes operational.
wp-config-personal-reduced-desc=If true, personal tesseracts will only output 65% of their normal power.
wp-config-debug-desc=Enables some debugging messages to the console.
