Automobilism2 = Allows construction of a faster and sturdier car, equipped with rocket launcher.
Automobilism3 = Allows construction of a faster and sturdier car, equipped with Gauss gun.
Tanks2 = Allows construction of heavier tanks, equipped with faster cannon and Flamethrower.
Tanks3 = Allows construction of Mammoth tanks, equipped with MAC and Flamethrower.
military-missiles = Allows construction of long range missiles.
auto-cannons = Allows the costruction of a light and nimble tank, armed with an Autocannon and Heavy Machine Gun (HMG).
tank-missile = Allows the costruction of a tank armed with twin rocket launchers and a missile launcher.
acid-cannon-shells = Allows construction of corrosive ammo for the Auto Cannon.  The strong acid component quickly eat the flesh of native life forms, but it's not effective on worms and hives.
