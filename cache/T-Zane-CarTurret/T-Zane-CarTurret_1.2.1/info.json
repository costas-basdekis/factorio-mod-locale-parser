{"name": "T-Zane-CarTurret", "version": "1.2.1", "factorio_version": "1.1", "title": "Zane's Car Turret Tanks Update", "author": "Dr.INZANE, GeneralTank", "dependencies": ["base >= 1.1", "? Krastorio2 >= 1.2.0"], "description": "Adds a defensive tower using the car's gun.  Slow shooting and easily destroyed, but cheap, it is meant for early defense (no research required :D).  Adds a later game Gatling Turret with extra high fire rate and some range boost over the standard gun turret of the base game.  Has support for low resolution and high resolution graphics since all the graphics come from the base game.  Also has support for Krastorio 2, wherein my turrets have buffed range to match the Krastorio 2 Gun Turret and are affected by the new damage and fire rate research options."}
