[mod-setting-description]
central-rails-rail-count=How many rails per side to install. 
central-rails-rail-ew-lines=Enter more than one y coordinate to place more lines. Separate with commas. Only even numbers will be applied. Odd values will be rounded up. eg 1 becomes 2.
central-rails-rail-ns-lines=Enter more than one x coordinate to place more lines. Separate with commas. Only even numbers will be applied. Odd values will be rounded up. eg 1 becomes 2.
central-rails-signal-spacing=How far apart to space each rail signal from each other.
central-rails-RHD=If enabled, then RHD signalling will be installed, otherwise LHD signalling will be used.
central-rails-power=If enabled, power poles will be installed
central-rails-powerpole=Select power poles to be installed. Defaults to Big Electric Poles. Note that alternatives (usually) have different maximum wiring distances. 
central-rails-northsouth=North/South orientation instead of East/West
central-rails-power-spacing=How far apart to space each power pole from each other.
central-rails-red-wiring=Install red wiring when poles are installed.
central-rails-green-wiring=Install green wiring when poles are installed.
central-rails-center-spacing=Distance between the innermost rails. Even values only.
central-rails-floor=Choice of floor type. 
central-rails-nauvis-only=By default Central Rails only constructs infrastructure on Nauvis. Uncheck this to apply to all surfaces.
central-rails-rails=Choice of rails.
central-rails-rails-bridge=Choice of rails used when water underneath.
central-rails-place-landfill=Place landfill under rails, power and signals but also where the floor would be.
central-rails-landfill-if-needed=Place landfill if needed, eg under rails, power and signals. If checked this will place landfill even if Place Landfill is unchecked. If the rails support placement directly on water then this option won't place landfill.
