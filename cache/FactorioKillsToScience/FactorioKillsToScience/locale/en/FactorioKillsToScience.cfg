startup-tech-boost=Seconds of free science credit at start
reward-neutral-kills=Science for kills vs. passive entities
cost-per-damage=Science in seconds of crafting time per kill
science-overflow-mode=Science overflow mode
science-decay-per-tick=Stored science decay per tick
[mod-setting-description]
startup-tech-boost=Start with some stored science. Not recommended for use with 'decay'. Set to 0 to disable. Note: Science costs are much higher than you think.
science-overflow-mode=Void destroys excess science. Keep keeps all excess science indefinitely, applying it to the next tech queued. Decay loses a portion of excess science after each tick.
science-decay-per-tick=Amount of science lost per tick (if science overflow mode is set to 'decay')
