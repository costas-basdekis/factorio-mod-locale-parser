[mod-setting-description]
CE-steel-force-enabled=Enables Steel Efficiency even if mod containing a furnace with recipe selection window is not hard-coded in. (Vanilla furnaces do not have a recipe selection window). 
CE-omni-maximum=Upper limit for the yield of any item, regardless of other settings. Default: 200.
CE-prob_increaseRate=Yield Increase rate per grade (applies to items; excludes science packs). Default 0.3
CE-prob_increaseRateVanillaScience=Yield Increase rate per grade (applies only to science packs). Default 0.2
CE-base_tech_cost=Base number of packs required for efficiency research. Default: 100
CE-base_tech_time=Base time required for research. Increases with level. Function is base_tech_time+(2*grade). Default: 5
CE-tech_grade_increase=technology cost increase. multiple of researh-grade. Default 40
CE-tech_grade_exponent=technology cost increase. exponent of research-grade. Default: 1.25
CE-techPack_y=science pack types required/amounts required variable Y. Default 5
CE-techPack_z=science pack types required/amounts required variable Z. Default 2
CE-vanilla-science-enabled=Generate research to improve yield of science pack crafting.
CE-energy-bonus-enabled=Energy Efficiency Bonus is inversely applied against Yield Increase Rate (The lower the Yield_Increase_Rate is, the greater the energy bonus given. Yield = 1 per grade results in no bonus to energy cost/time required to craft. The actual bonus is dependent on many variables including: the total resulting output, the number of total efficiency tiers, the current efficiency level, and the energy cost per unit or in other words: the base_time)
CE-enforced-denominator-resolution=Ugh. In simple terms: what is the maximum multiplier for ingredient costs (determined by decimal "Yield_Increase_Rate" to fraction conversion) to generate recipes. Smaller numbers force a smaller ingredient cost but cause some recipes to have incorrect input/output values based on the desired yield ouput. 100 i found was a fairly reasonable resolution. (deviation is only ever 1%)
CE-debug-logging=Enable debug logging. Prints info to log about what mod is doing.
