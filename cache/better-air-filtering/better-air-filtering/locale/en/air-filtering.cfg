[technology-description]
air-filtering-1=Enables the crafting of passive Air Filter Machines to improve air quality by reducing pollution.
air-filtering-2=A stronger air filter that uses electricity to pull pollution towards it from a 2 chunk radius.
air-filtering-3=An even stronger air filter, capable of cleaning pollution in a 3 chunk radius.
reusable-air-filters=More strudy air filters that can be recycled with future technology.
air-filter-recycling=Used air filters can be reused after being recycled by using a bit of coal to refill them. Beware that there is a slight chance the filter breaks in the recycling process.


[mod-setting-name]
baf-update-interval=Update interval

[mod-setting-description]
baf-update-interval=Updates are implemented efficiently and are spread over an UPDATE INTERVAL amount of ticks. The default of 20 gives three updates per second. 30 would result in 2 updates per second for example.
