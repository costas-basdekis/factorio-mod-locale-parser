[item-description]
sentinel-alarm=Detects mobile biters within range specified by R signal (default is 32 tiles, <0 - disable scanning), sending signals defined on it to connected circuit network. Range signal (R) can be set on combinator itself, or supplied from the network.

[mod-setting-description]
bds-signal-update-interval=Delay between updating *some* signals on Sentinel Combinators, in Game Ticks (60 ticks = 1 second at 1x speed). Full update of all combinators is done in interval * steps ticks, e.g. 12 * 10 = 120 ticks (every 2 seconds) by default.
bds-signal-update-steps=Steps for splitting update workload (default = 10). Can be increased to spread-out the scans between more game ticks, if e.g. many of these combinators are used with large scan areas.
