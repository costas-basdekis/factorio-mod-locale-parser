biosolarpanel-1-pollution-absorption=This setting affects the amount of pollution tier 1 Photosynthesis Panels absorb. By default, it's set to the standard eight. Negative values can be used to make photosynthesis panels produce pollution instead.
biosolarpanel-2-pollution-absorption=This setting affects the amount of pollution tier 2 Photosynthesis Panels absorb. By default, it's set to the standard eight. Negative values can be used to make photosynthesis panels produce pollution instead.
biosolarpanel-3-pollution-absorption=This setting affects the amount of pollution tier 3 Photosynthesis Panels absorb. By default, it's set to the standard eight. Negative values can be used to make photosynthesis panels produce pollution instead.

biosolarpanel-1-crafting-speed=Enter 100 times the value of the crafting speed you want Tier 1 Photosynthesis Panels to have. This value will be divided by 100 to get the actual crafting speed. 100x the value is necessary as a workaround to decimal values causing problems in the startup settings.
biosolarpanel-2-crafting-speed=Enter 100 times the value of the crafting speed you want Tier 2 Photosynthesis Panels to have. This value will be divided by 100 to get the actual crafting speed. 100x the value is necessary as a workaround to decimal values causing problems in the startup settings.
biosolarpanel-3-crafting-speed=Enter 100 times the value of the crafting speed you want Tier 3 Photosynthesis Panels to have. This value will be divided by 100 to get the actual crafting speed. 100x the value is necessary as a workaround to decimal values causing problems in the startup settings.

biotech-bioreactor-1-crafting-speed=Enter 100 times the value of the crafting speed you want Tier 1 Bioreactors to have. This value will be divided by 100 to get the actual crafting speed. 100x the value is necessary as a workaround to decimal values causing problems in the startup settings.
biotech-ext-bioreactor-2-crafting-speed=Enter 100 times the value of the crafting speed you want Tier 2 Bioreactors to have. This value will be divided by 100 to get the actual crafting speed. 100x the value is necessary as a workaround to decimal values causing problems in the startup settings.
