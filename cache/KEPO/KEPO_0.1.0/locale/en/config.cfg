[technology-description]
uranium-processing-kepo=Uranium Ore is processed in Centrifuges. Every cycle the product has a 99.3% chance to be Uranium-238 and a 0.7% chance to be Uranium-235. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occuring fissile element. A fissile element is required to create nuclear chain reactions for power generation and powerful weapons.
uranium-ammo-kepo=Advanced ammunition from Uranium-238 for higher hardness and weight, resulting in massive damage.
nuclear-power-kepo=Powerful and sophisticated method of power generation using Nuclear Fuel Cells.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing-kepo=The process of recovering Uranium-238 from Irradiated Nuclear Fuel Cells.
kovarex-enrichment-process-kepo=The process to create Plutonium-239 from Uranium-238. Breeder Fuel Cells burn for a much shorter time transmuting Uranium-238 into Plutonium-239 which can be recovered in reprocessing. Plutonium-239 is a manufactured fissile element. A fissile element is required to create nuclear chain reactions for power generation and powerful weapons.
nuclear-fuel=Top tier burner fuel.
atomic-bomb-kepo=Devastating form of rockets used to eradicate anything in huge areas at a time.
