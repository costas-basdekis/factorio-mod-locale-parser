{"name": "KEPO", "title": "KEPO", "description": "Kovarex Enrichment Process Overhaul. A slightly more realistic nuclear fuel cycle from uranium ore to atomic warhead. Implements Plutonium-239 in the nuclear fuel cycle by using Breeder Fuel Cells in Nuclear Reactors to consume Uranium-238 and produce fissile material in the form of Plutonium-239. Adds Plutonium-239 recipes for existing products requiring fissile material: Nuclear Fuel Cells, Nuclear Fuel, and Nuclear Missiles. There are other (primarily fuel production related) changes.
