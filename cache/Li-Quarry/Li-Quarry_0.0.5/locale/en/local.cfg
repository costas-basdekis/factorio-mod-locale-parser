[mod-setting-description]
quarry-stone-waste-percentage=Sets how much stone quarries dig up rather than the selected resource.\n0 disables stone as byproduct\nDefault 0%
quarry-recipe-speed=Lower values mean faster recipes, and vice versa.\nNot related to crafting speed multiplier, that affects quarries
quarry-crafting-speed=Higher values mean quarries craft faster.\nNot related to recipe speed multiplier, that affects recipes.
quarry-power-usage=Higher values indicate higher power usage.
quarry-complex-mode=Quarries mine mineral rich stone from which the ores are extracted. Basically, adds an extra step to the quarry process.
quarry-pollution-mult=Sets pollution emission for quarries and crusher.\n0 disables pollution.\nDefault: 1
