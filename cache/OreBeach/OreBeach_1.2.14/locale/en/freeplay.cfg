intro-page-line-detail-02=Refreshing interval for entities with their UI : __1__ seconds.
intro-page-line-detail-03=Grow speed:        >= __1__/s[item=stone][item=coal][item=iron-ore][item=copper-ore]     >= __2__/s [item=uranium-ore] (the further the faster)
intro-page-line-detail-04=Duration to reach max:  __1__min[item=stone][item=coal][item=iron-ore][item=copper-ore]                __2__min[item=uranium-ore]
intro-page-line-detail-05=But for early game, the duration is extended a bit.
intro-page-line-detail-06=Can divide == How many times can this entity divide.
intro-page-line-detail-07=Safe end == How much probability does this entity NOT end into water and become normal ore entity.
intro-page-line-detail-08=Divides in water == How much probability can this entity divide even the destination is water.
intro-page-line-detail-09=The arc shows on each ore is (current amount/max amount).
intro-page-line-detail-10=When it reaches a full circle, the entity turns into one of three, 
intro-page-line-detail-11=  [fluid=water],[entity=crude-oil], or normal ore entity.
intro-page-line-detail-12=Color of the arc indicates the tendency of the corresponding ore.
intro-page-line-detail-13=Red means reaching max in 15min. Yellow means exhausting in 15min.


intro-page-line-detail-06-xxxxxxxx=To crude oil == How much probability does this entity end with [entity=crude-oil].
