battery-locomotive=Runs by electricity. The train is recharged when it stops and within electric pole coverage area. It has the same acceleration and maximum speed as a coal-fired locomotive.
battery-locomotive-mk2=Runs by electricity. The train is recharged when it stops and within electric pole coverage area. It has the same acceleration and maximum speed as a rocket-fuel-fired locomotive.
battery-locomotive-mk3=Runs by electricity. The train is recharged when it stops and within electric pole coverage area. It has the same acceleration and maximum speed as a nuclear-fuel-fired locomotive.
