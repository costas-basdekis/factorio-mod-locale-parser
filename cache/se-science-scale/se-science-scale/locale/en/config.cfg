[mod-setting-description]
science-multiplier=How many terrestrial science packs to have per first tier space science pack. (Tier 1 space science packs: Astronomic, Biological, Energy, Material.)
deep-science-multiplier=How many first tier science packs to have per second tier science pack. (Tier 2 space science packs: currently only deep space.)
minimal-count=Minimal cycle number a tech needs to have for it to be targeted by this mod. (Set to 0 to disable. Doesn't effect any leveled technologies. Note that this runs before the map's science cost multiplier.)
minimal-count-soft=If any targeted technology ends up with less cycles than this, it gets overwritten. (Set to 0 to disable. Doesn't effecy any leveled technologies. Note that this runs before the map's science cost multiplier.)
count-scale=A number to multiply the count diviser by, before applying it to the count. (1 = direct relation between pack numbers and count change. 0.5 = double effect. 2 = half the effect. 0 to disable. as long as this value is equivilent to the time scale value, tech research time should not change, barring rounding errors. setting very small values could cause unpredictable results.)
time-scale=A number to multiply the time multiplier by, before applying it to the time. (1 = direct relation between pack numbers and time change. 0.5 = half the effect. 2 = double effect. 0 to disable. as long as this value is equivilent to the count scale value, tech research time should not change, barring rounding errors. setting very small values could cause unpredictable results.)
ssc-ignore-qol=Ignore techs provided by the QOL research mod, to avoid some weird interactions that cause inintended pack count shenanigans.
