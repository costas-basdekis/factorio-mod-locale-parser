[mod-setting-description]
burners-only-disable-non-original-burner-inserters=Disables the burner-versions of inserter, long-handed inserter, fast inserter, filter inserter, stack inserter and stack filter inserter.
burners-only-add-slow-long-handed-burner-inserter=Useful when activating 'Disable non original burner inserters'. Slow long-handed burner inserters have half the speed of a regular long-handed inserter.
burners-only-inserter-conversion-energy-cost-multiplier=Energy costs multiplier when converting inserter, long-handed inserter, fast inserter, filter inserter, stack inserter or stack filter inserter to it's burner variant. Vanilla value is 1.
burners-only-non-inserter-conversion-energy-cost-multiplier=Energy costs multiplier when converting assemblers, refineries, etc to it's burner variant. Vanilla value is 1.
burners-only-transfer-boiler-pollution-to-burner-entities=Adds the pollution that would proportionally be created by boilers to the new burner entities.
burners-only-burner-conversion-pollution-factor=Pollution multiplier that takes effect when converting an entity to a burner one. Vanilla value is 1.
burners-only-power-poles-have-no-wires=Some entities like beacons cannot be converted to a burner variant. This option will requiere a power source next to these entities, because power poles cannot be connected to each other.
