[mod-setting-description]

wf-spark-interval=Interval between starting checks for wildfire sparks in factorio ticks (60 ticks = 1s at 1x speed).
wf-spark-interval-jitter=Random value to add/subtract from spark interval, picked each time between 0 and this value (in factorio ticks).

wf-check-interval=Interval between picking wildfire location when fire should start, in factorio ticks.\nEach time random location is picked and checked if fire should be started there.\nThese checks are repeated until either suitable location is found or check count limit.
wf-check-radius-v2=Radius (in tiles) to check trees in around randomly-picked location, for whether it's suitable for starting a fire there.

wf-check-sample-n=Number of samples to pick evenly around checked point to match against restrictions too.\n0 disables this multisampling algorithm.
wf-check-sample-offset=Offset of sampled points from the center. Should probably be (much) larger than check radius.

wf-min-green-trees-v2=Min green (non-dead) trees in the center of the checked area for it to be suitable to start a wildfire.
wf-max-dead-trees-v2=Max dead (burnt or pollution-killed) trees within checked area to be suitable to start a wildfire.\nIdea is to skip areas (near) where fires already happened.\nWith multiple sampled points, sum of all dead trees is checked against this limit.
wf-green-dead-balance-v2=Ratio of alive to dead trees to make area suitable for starting a wildfire.\nE.g. 20 = there have to be 20 alive trees to each dead one in the area.\nAll sampled points must pass this check separately.
