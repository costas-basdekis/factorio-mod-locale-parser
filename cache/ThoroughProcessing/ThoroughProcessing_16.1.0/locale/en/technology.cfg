[technology-description]
tp_incinerator=Need to get rid of something. Fire burns away your items to ashes and hot air.
tp_electric-incinerator=The electric version of the incinerator is more clean and also faster.
tp_crusher=Crush ore to refine and gain more ressources out of it.
tp_pulverizer=Pulverize ore to maximize the gain from ores.
steel-processing-2=Allows cheaper but more complex steel smelting.
tp_hydrocyclone=With the help of the flowing liquid, it is possible to separate useful fractions from not very useful ones.
tp_nucular_sintez=Do you need in some chemistry elements? Nucular sintez will help you.
