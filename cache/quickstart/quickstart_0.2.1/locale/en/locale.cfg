quickstart-clear=Replace default starting items
quickstart-respawn=Apply when respawning

[mod-setting-description]
quickstart-clear=Replaces the vanilla starting items. Disabling this will add the configured items instead. This may or may not remove things added by other mods, depending on loading order and how they insert their items.
quickstart-respawn=Enabling this setting will also give you the starting items if you die and respawn. Disabling it will not change respawn at all.
