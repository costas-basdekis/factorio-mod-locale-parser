[mod-setting-description]
npi-trans=At 100%, icons are completely invisible. Lower values are more opaque. 0% is vanilla behavior, useful if you just want to scale the icons.
npi-fuel=If checked, the blinking red fuel icons are included. This should work for any burner entity, including vehicles, boilers, furnaces, etc.
npi-ammo=If checked, the blinking red no ammo icons are included. This includes gun turrets, modded gun turrets, and vanilla flamethrower turrets (which use the no fuel icon).
npi-scale=Scales icons the given amount - 0.5 is half, 2.0 is double size. Only affects fuel and ammo if they are enabled.
npi-logistic=If checked, the blinking yellow 'Out of logistic network' icons are included. This includes icons for all types of logistic chest.
