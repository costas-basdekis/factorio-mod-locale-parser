[mod-setting-description]
	long-hands=Like Long Reach, but less cheat.
	bonus-inventory=Slightly extends inventory space.
	bonus-items=Gives bonus items (some drones, car, armor and ect.) when you start new game.
	easy-steel=Removes silicon from the steel recipes.
	k_scale_info_icons=Increases the size of the icons that display the contents in large chests and warehouses.
	difficult-gold=Gold will require chlorine for mining.
	loaders=Adds loaders. You can turn it off and use your own.
	reb-decorative-removal=Set Decorative Removal = 95% for vanilla covering. If this option turn on, then when you place a ground covering, such as concrete, grass and bushes will be removed with a 95% probability. If this option turn off, then you have grass and bushes on you concrete and stone bricks (vanilla).
	reb-oil=Remove infinite oil. It's ok and recommended.
	reb-science-packs=More balanced recipes for Krastorio. Highly recommended.
	reb-technology=Changes vanilla technology. Highly recommended.
	keep-infinite-technology=If technology rebalance is enabled, and this option is enabled, infinite technologies remain infinite(and other become infinite), otherwise will be limited (default: false)
	reb-circuits=Changes recipes for circuits. Highly recommended.
	reb-nuclear=Everything is redone. Now you can build compact and powerfull Nuclear stations. It's very efficient and ups-frendly, but produce fuel become much more expensive. In vanilla 100k uranium ore give 3k uranium-235, now around 0.8k-1k. Also reduced bonus from a neighbor and...never destroy a working reactor! This part of mod highly recommended.
	reb-stack-size=Increases stacks. Mainly for resources.
	reb-rounds=Adds coal into the "firearm magazine" recipe and makes "piercing rounds magazine" cheaper.
	reb-fuel=Useful option if you play with difficult enemies. You can also disable this option if you want to complicate the game.
	reb-power-poles=Increases the size of the supply area and the length of the connection.
	reb-radar=Increases coverage, but also increases power consumption.
	reb-bobenemies=Rebalances enemies for using with Krastorio. Highly recommended.
	unlock-deep-drill=Allows you to mine rich rocks anywhere. Too cheat. Not recommended to turn on this option if you play with SE mod.
	k_powerful-beacon=Makes "Singularity beacon" twice as powerful. That is, makes it the same as it was before version 1.2.11. The beacon had to be changed because it was too powerful and caused some bugs in the game. Enabling this option is NOT RECOMMENDED, but if the update broke your factory or ratios, then you can enable it. It will not break your game. More information about this bug is written in the changelog (1.2.11 update).
	k_more_waste=Adds stone into recipe for enriching iron and copper.
	reb-train=If enabled, train cargo space is higher but train will consume more fuel, this is meant for reduce train deliveries (default: enabled)
	reb-damage=Rebalance all damage done by player weapons (Turrets, ammo...)(default: enabled)
	reb-damage-technologies-bonuses=Rebalance the bonus given by technologies to ammo and turrets damage and attack speed(default: enabled)
	reb-beacon=Doubles the beacon module slot(default: enabled)
	productivity-beacon=Enable productivity effect in beacons and in singularity beacons(default: disabled)
	free-circuit-network-wire=Red and green circuit network wires have no cost, so you can craft it without use any ingredient(default: disabled)
	reb-ore=HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Rebalance ore conusme from 1 to 3 for increase the difficulty. ATTENTION! Krastorio is balanced on this setting, if is disabled the recipes balancing will be compromised(default: enabled)
	multy-ore=Multiply in ore recipes(smelting): ingredients and products and time (the work/time yield don't change). This is for reduce the overmodules effect on furnaces that break the game products computation on tick(default: enabled)
	disable-matter-is-science=Disable matter is science technology, for don't be able to create science pack directly from matter(default: disable/technology active)
