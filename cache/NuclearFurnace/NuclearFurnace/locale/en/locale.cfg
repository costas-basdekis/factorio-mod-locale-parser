nuclear-furnace-1=Inefficient as lighting water on fire with a blow torch. The theory is however that anything will burn once enough heat is applied...
nuclear-furnace-2=Tier up to double its crafting speed. Efficiency gets even worse as the cost.
nuclear-furnace-3=Tier up to double its crafting speed. Efficiency goes even lower.
nuclear-furnace-4=Tier up to double its crafting speed. You see the pattern with efficiency, right?
nuclear-furnace-5=Tier up to double its crafting speed. It has bottomed out. Talk about your max/min specs!

[mod-setting-name]
nf-assembling-machine-type=Furnace type?
nf-furnace-upgrades=More furnaces?
nf-furnace-modules=Allow modules?

[mod-setting-description]
nf-assembling-machine-type=Vanilla furnace-like smelting or selecting recipe like assembling machine.
nf-furnace-upgrades=Just one furnace or 5 tiers with crafting speeds doubling each time from 7.5 to 120.
nf-furnace-modules=Allow modules in furnaces and effects? Does NOT change effectivity.
