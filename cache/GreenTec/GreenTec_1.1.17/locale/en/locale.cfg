absorbtion-bricks=Allows to create absorbing pollution of the coating
organic-concrete=Opens chemically resistant coatings with enhanced pollution absorption
virus-rocket=In the area of the explosion, it creates a biologically active viral cloud aimed at destroying biters and reducing their evolution by an average of 0.002% for each affected. Beetles turn into bloodthirsty zombies and attack their nests and worms. After death, they spread a viral infection to other biters, emit a toxic cloud
virus-artillery-shell=In the area of the explosion, it creates a biologically active viral cloud aimed at destroying biters and reducing their evolution by an average of 0.02% for each affected. Beetles turn into bloodthirsty zombies and attack their nests and worms. After death, they spread a viral infection to other biters, emit a toxic cloud. Large lesion area
