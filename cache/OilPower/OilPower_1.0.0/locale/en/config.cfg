[entity-description]
light-oil-generator=Turns Light oil into power, through a gasoline engine.
heavy-oil-generator=Turns Heavy oil into power, through a diesel engine.
petroleum-gas-generator=Turns Petroleum gas into power, through a gasoline engine. It can't go into the light oil generator because Factorio.
lubricant-generator=Turns lubricant into power, because that stuff is actually flammable. (Who knew?)
naphtha-generator=Burns naphtha, if you are brave enough.
fuel-oil-generator=Burns fuel oil, as it's very fuel efficient.
mineral-oil-generator=Burns mineral oil , because it IS flammable, just not very efficient.
