[recipe-description]
logicarts-paint=Untinted paint for path tiles.
logicarts-sticker=Place stickers onto path tiles to direct carts based on their contents. Click a sticker set the item.
logicarts-path=Cart will follow the arrow.
logicarts-path-dual-straight=Cart will follow the arrow in either direction.
logicarts-path-dual-turn=Cart will turn the corner in either direction. If entering against an arrow, cart will turn. If entering with an arrow, cart will continue straight.

logicarts-stop=Cart will stop for 3 seconds of inactivity or per circuit network.
logicarts-stop-load=Cart will load filtered trunk slots from the adjacent chest.
logicarts-stop-unload=Cart will unload filtered trunk slots to the adjacent chest.
logicarts-stop-supply=Cart will deliver items to the adjacent chest as though it were a requester chest. Connect a constant combinator to the chest and set the required items and counts as negative values.
logicarts-stop-dump=Cart will unload unfiltered trunk slots to the adjacent chest.
logicarts-stop-accept=Cart will load as many items as possible from the adjacent chest.
logicarts-stop-deploy=Place, fuel and equip a cart from an adjacent chest.
logicarts-stop-retire=Remove a cart and its contents into an adjacent chest.

logicarts-turn=Cart will take the optional route if it is clear.
logicarts-turn-blocked=Cart will take the alternate route if the path is blocked.
logicarts-turn-fuel=Cart will take the optional route if low on fuel.
logicarts-continue=Cart will follow the arrow off road, continuing straight until another path is found.
logicarts-continue-dual-straight=Cart will follow the arrow off road in either direction.
logicarts-continue-dual-turn=Cart will turn the corner off road in either direction. If entering against an arrow, cart will turn. If entering with an arrow, cart will continue straight.
logicarts-yield=Cart will yield if the path is in use, then continue straight.
