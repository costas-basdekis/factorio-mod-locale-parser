RGI-increase-stack-sizes=Increases the stack size of wood, landfil, and refined concrete to 1000.
RGI-night-vision-equipment-changes=Changes night vision equipment to be a 1x1 item (instead of 2x2) and it also makes night as bright as day (instead of tinting the world green).
RGI-construction-bot-queue-multiplier=Adjusts construction bot queue so they can handle more active requests (this may cause more lag). This value is a multiplier of the base/default value.
RGI-max-zoom-level=The max zoom level. The game default max zoom level is 13. Setting the max zoom level higher than the default can cause lag when fully zoomed out.
RGI-turn-off-night-completely=Turns off night completely, but only visually. Solar panels will still react as if it is night.
