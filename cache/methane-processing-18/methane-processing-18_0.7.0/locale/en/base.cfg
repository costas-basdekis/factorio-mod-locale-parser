[technology-description]
chemistry=Allows you gather hydrogen, oxygen and carbon-dioxide from water and air.
acetylene-processing=Acetylene and benzene can be manufactured by the partial combustion of methane. They are used for acrylic plastics and lubricants.
advanced-acetylene-processing=Allows the cracking of benzene rings into acetylene.
advanced-syngas-processing=Steam reforming provides a much quicker supply of syngas.
formaldehyde-processing=Formaldehyde is an important component in explosives, insulations and plastics.
methane-processing=Methane can be generated from hydrogen and carbon-dioxide. It can be used as fuel or as feedstock in chemical processes.
methanol-processing=Methanol or methyl alcohol can be used in fuel calls or to synthetisize formaldehyde.
syngas-processing=Synthesis gas is a fuel mixture consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide often carbon dioxide. It is used for the production of Methanol.
oxalic-acid=Used to mine uranium.
