[mod-setting-description]
k2-modules-efficiency-rebalance=Increase the energy consumption reduction of effectivity modules 2 and 3 of the base game to make them a viable option. Also allows other settings to modify their bonuses (like pollution/speed). (Default: enabled)
k2-modules-reoranize=Sort all modules into 3 seperate subgroups to increase the cleanliness of the gui if enabled. (Default: enabled)
k2-modules-efficiency-pollution-bonus=Add an additional pollution reduction to efficiency modules.[color=orange]\nIn the base game, the pollution multiplier depends only on the power consumption multiplier, which is capped at -80%. This pollution reduction multiplier can reduce the pollution further up to another -80%. The new formula is: pollution per second x power consumption multiplier [in %, capped at -80%] x pollution multiplier [in %, capped at -80%][/color]\nWith this it is possible to reduce pollution up to 4% of the original value, but this is mainly used to counterbalance the large energy consumption multipliers of fully beaconed setups and make higher tiers of efficiency modules a viable option. (Default: enabled)
k2-modules-efficiency-speed-bonus=Add a small speed bonus to higher tiers of efficiency modules, because in the very endgame with the introduction of antimatter, power production becomes less and less important and the bonuses of efficiency modules are too weak compared to other types. (Default: low)
k2-modules-efficiency-bonus=Increase / decrease the energy consumption reduction of effectivity modules 4, 5 and 6. (Default: default)
k2-modules-productivity-bonus=Increase / descrease the productivity bonus of productivity modules 4, 5 and 6. (Default: default)
k2-modules-productivity-alternative-graphics=The color of the lights of the alternative graphics have the same color as the vanilla ones, yellow. The lights in the default graphics of this mod were changed to orange, to better match the colours of the lower tier modules.\nCheck this to switch to the alternative graphics. (Default: disabled)
k2-modules-energy-processing-circuit-tritium=Choose between tritium and imersite-crystals as an ingredient for energy processing circuits.[color=orange]\nIt is recommended to leave it as default, because Tritium does not have another use after you transition from fusion energy to antimatter. Having it as a ingredient gives you a reason to keep or even expand its production line. Imersite on the other hand is used in most late game items anyway.[/color] (Default: tritium)
k2-modules-energy-processing-circuit-color=The color of energy processing circuit icon. (Default: purple)
k2-modules-crafting-time=The ratio between the tiers of modules 4, 5 and 6 by adjusting the crafting time of the recipes. In Krastorio all modules have a ration of 5:1, meaning it takes 5 fully working assemblers of the previous tier of modules to produce enough modules to feed 1 assembler crafting the next tier of modules.[color=orange]\nIt is recommended keep the ratio close to the default, otherwise it can lead to ridiculously long or short craft times and strange rounding errors.[/color] (Default: 5)
k2-modules-recipe-difficulty=Increase / descrease the difficulty of the recipes by doubling / halving the output of the energy processing circuit recipe, the main ingredient of the new modules. It does not change the ratio between modules. (Default: default)
k2-modules-recipe-multiply-capped=[color=orange]With the new modules fully beaconed Advanced assembling machines or Advanced chemical plants can reach such a high craft speed that some recipes can go over 60 operations per second, making the game engine not iterate all recipe cycles correctly. The game can only make 1 craft/tick (60 sec).[/color]\nEnable this option to multiply all numbers of the recipes that can reach that cap by 10. All ratios and input/sec and output/sec remain the same.\nWhile this is not enabled by default, it is advised to enable it once you reach the endgame and start using fully beaconed setups with the new modules of this mod. (Default: false)
k2-modules-recipe-multiply-capped-whitelist=Add a name of a recipe to this list to have it included in the list of recipes being modified by the recipe speed cap fix. By default, all recipes for Krastorio 2 and the base game of Factorio that require a change are already included. If you play with other mods that add recipes that you fully module, add them here.\n[color=orange]Use this formula to determine if the recipe is affected by the speed cap limitation:\n[max machine speed] x [max productivity bonus] / (60 x [crafting time])\nIf this is bigger than 1 the recipe will be affected by the limitation and should be added to this list if you plan to fully speed module it.\n[/color]For example, to include the recipes of electronic circuits and advanced circuits (alredy enabled by default) use the following formatting:\nelectronic-circuit, advanced-circuit\n[color=orange]Enable F4 ➜ show_debug_info_in_tooltips and hover over a recipe to get its recipe-name in case you are not sure if the name is correct. If the same name appears on the whitelist, the blacklist takes priority.[/color]
k2-modules-recipe-multiply-capped-blacklist=Add a name of a recipe to this list to prevent it from being modified by the recipe speed cap fix.\nThe formatting is the same as for the whitelist: for example, to exclude the recipes of electronic circuits and advanced circuits write:\nelectronic-circuit, advanced-circuit\n[color=orange]Enable F4 ➜ show_debug_info_in_tooltips and hover over a recipe to get its recipe-name in case you are not sure if the name is correct. If the same name appears on the whitelist, the blacklist takes priority.[/color]
