[mod-setting-description]
bp-craftable=Set if you want to craft and place building platforms.
bp-platform-generator=Choose which platform world generator you want.\n- Default : Default generation using the ingame world generation. Platform placement are seed and config dependant. Size and frequency can be changed.\n- concentric-circle : Big platform at spawn then the rest in concentric circle with speed platform going in the cardinals and intercadinals directions. Not seed or config dependant.
bp-speed-penalty=Apply a 35% speed penalty to players.\nOnly concentric-circle generation config. Do not have any effect in other generation.
bp-tiles-speed-bonus=Apply a 45% speed bonus to all tiles with speed bonus superior to the ground.\nOnly concentric-circle generation config. Do not have any effect in other generation.
bp-speed-platform-speed-bonus=Apply a 150% movement speed to speed platforms.\nOnly concentric-circle generation config. Do not have any effect in other generation.
bp-recipe=Only if building platforms are craftable. Set the difficulty of the recipe.\nnormal : recipe using a bit of stone, stone-brick and water.\nnormal-expensive : Same recipe as 'normal' but ingredient requirement have been multiply by 10.\nelectronic : recipe that need some advanced circuit but less stone and lubricant in place of water. So in the end, you use oil, copper and iron with stone to have platform.\nelectronic-expensive : Same recipe as 'electronic' but ingredient requirement have been multiply by 10.\ncheap : a very cheap recipe that make you wonder why using this mod in the first place.
bp-unrestrict-power=Solar panels, boilers, accumulators, engines and reactors will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-boiler=Boilers will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-combinator=Combinators will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-roboport=Roboports will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-logistic=Logistic chests will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-storageTank=Storage tanks will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-radar=Radars will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-substation=Substations will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-furnace=Furnaces will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-assembling-machine=Assembling machines and centrifuges will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-lab=Labs will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-beacon=Beacons will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-unrestrict-rocket-silo=Rocket silos will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-old-texture=If you want the old white concrete texture for building platforms.
bp-block-tile-on-platform=Will prevent any tiles to be placeable on platforms. A gap (set by vanilla game) will appear between tiles and platforms. To make it disappear use water-fix mod (you can find it on the mod portal).
bp-add-long-range-radar=Add a radar alongside vanilla one for long range scanning to find far suitable platforms. This radar don't reveal nearby area but scan chunk twice further than vanilla at a double speed. It consume more than thrice as much energy though.
bp-spacing-between-platform=Amount of tile between each group of platform vertically and horizontally.\nOnly grid generation config. Do not have any effect in other generation.
bp-side-length=Length of the side of each square of platform\nOnly grid generation config. Do not have any effect in other generation.
bp-factorissimo2-factory-as-platform=Factory floor will act as platform and allow all blocked building. The location of the factory doesn't matter.
bp-aai-programmable-vehicles-unrestrict-depot=AAI vehicle depot will be unrestricted independently of AAI unrestrict setting.
bp-flowControl=All Flow Control's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-alertCombinator=The alert combinator will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-reactors=All Reactors's entities will be placeable outside platforms.\nNot recommended to untick this as it suffer from incompatibility (Reactors mod part) that can cause a game to exit to main menu.
bp-circuitNetworkSwitch=All Circuit Network Switch's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-factorissimo2=All Factorissimo2's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-highVoltage=All High Voltage's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-warehousing=All Warehousing's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-teleportation=All Teleportation's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-stoneWaterWell=All Stone Water Well's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-waterWell=All Water Well's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-aaiIndustry=All AAI Industry's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-aaiProgrammableStructures=All AAI Programmable Structures's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-aaiProgrammableVehicles=All AAI Programmable Vehicles's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
bp-quarry=All Quarry's entities will be placeable outside platforms.
