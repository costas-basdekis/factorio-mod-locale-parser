[mod-setting-description]
arborium-tree-time=The amount of time to grow a sapling from a seed in a basic arborium.\nMin 20 seconds. Max 500 seconds. Default 30.
arborium-mulch-time=The amount of time to mulch sapling in a basic mulcher.\nMin 10 seconds. Max 500 seconds. Default 10.
arborium-min-wood=The least amount of raw wood that can be returned when mulching a sapling.\nMin 0. Max 4. Default 3.
arborium-max-wood=The most raw wood that can be returned when mulching a sapling.\nMin 1. Max 4. Default 4.
arborium-min-seed=The least amount of seeds that can be returned when mulching a sapling.\nMin 0. Max 4. Default 1.
arborium-max-seed=The most seeds that can be returned when mulching a sapling.\nMin 1. Max 4. Default 3.
arborium-tree-seed=The number of seeds received when chopping down a tree.\nMin 1. Max 4. Default 2.
arborium-seed-use=If enabled, seeds can be smelted in a furnace to produce extra wood.\nIf not, seeds can be burned as fuel instead.
arborium-force-grid=If enabled, trees will be aligned to the grid like buildings are.
arborium-smelt-power=Higher numbers make smelting seeds more effective, lower numbers makes smelting seeds less effective.\nDepending on if "seeds smelt to wood" is enabled, either increases fuel strength of seeds or decreases how many seeds need to be smelted to make wood.\nMin 0. Max 5. Default 2.
arborium-dead-trees-give-seeds=If enabled, dead trees have a chance to drop random seeds when mined.
arborium-dead-trees-seeds-rarity=Increasing this makes dead trees give random seeds at a higher rate.\n(Does nothing unless "Dead trees give seeds" is enabled)\nMin 0. Max 12. Default 5.
arborium-ignore-coral=If enabled, coral will not drop seeds, and cannot be grown in arboriums.
