[mod-setting-description]
shia_ci_temp_unlock=If a cest does have locked slots, they will be unlocked before putting back items and locked again afterwards. If the chests normally are stuffed with items, that may be helpfull to have a save way to always clean the inserters.
shia_ci_ignore_disabled=If not checked, inserters in front of the combinater will not be affected if the combinator output is set to "OFF".
shia_ci_check_one_more=If disabled, the check will stop as soon as it does not encounter an inserter. If enabled, 2 spaces will be checked and only stops if both are empty.
shia_ci_go_for_trains=Will do the check for any train leaving a station (if arrived in automatic mode and is not empty at leaving). The check will be done for the areas on both sides of every cargo wagon connected to the train. Wagons which are not aligned horizontally or vertically will be skipped!
shia_ci_lines_to_check=Set the width of the area to check at the sides of every cargo wagon. If facing upwards, the area extends to the left and right. (Facing sidewards it sets the range for up and down.)
shia_ci_extend_length=Increase the area in length. If facing up/down, the area also extends up and down OVER the length of the wagon. (Facing sidewards the area extends to left and right over the length of the wagon).
shia_ci_deconstruction="off" will do nothing when deconstructing. "inserter only" will be the normal behavior of just cleaning the inserter. "inserter and ground" will clean the inserter and also the area at the drop position of the inserter if there is an item on the ground. Will skip this if the item is on a different entity like a belt.
shia_ci_split_by_count=Only inserters in full automatic cleaning mode: If disabled, the calculation of all inserters will be split over the count of frames which is set at the "Split value" (60 = 1 second / at least one inserter per frame). If active, every frame will run the check for the number of inserters set at "Split value".
shia_ci_split_int=The count of either the frames or the inserters. Please see the "Split by count" tooltip.
shia_ci_clean_effect=Shows a small visual effect every time a cleaning happens. "off" disables this function. "laser" shots a laser beam from start-point to end-point of each cleaning. (This are just visual effects and doesn't do anyhing to the game itself / also runs if a cleaning was NOT succesfull)
shia_ci_active_effect=Shows a visual indicator for inserters in full automatic mode. "off" disables this function. "arrow" shows a small arrow in the opposite direction of the inserter. "cloud" shows a small cloud at the inserter. (This are just visual effects and doesn't do anyhing to the game itself)
