[mod-setting-description]
regrowth-enable-on-nauvis=Enabling this will turn on regrowth on the normal starting game surface. Typically used with a vanilla game or any game that uses the default starting surface.
regrowth-enable-on-all-surfaces=Enabling this will automatically enable regrowth on any surface that is created while the mod is running.
regrowth-enable-automatic-cleanup=Enables automatic cleanup of chunks at a regular interval (set by the cleanup interval). Can be enabled/disabled during runtime.
regrowth-cleanup-interval-mins=This is the number of minutes between map clears. Clearing the map causes a large lag spike / freeze for a few seconds, so don't set this too small unless you're just doing it for testing.
