[mod-setting-description]
se-core-processing-fragment-input-count=Modifies the Fragments needed for Basic Core Fragment Processing. Lower Values can make it significantly easier.
limit-research-to-space=Any research that requires tech cards higher than chemical is limited to space research laboratories by disabling advanced and singularity research laboratories.
fix-optimisation-card=Adds a recipe for Optimisation Cards that does not rely on the rocket silo to return Space Research Data. NOTE: Without this option it is currently impossible to make Optimisation Cards, which will lock you out of a lot of techs.
decouple-fusion-energy-from-se=Removes any prerequisites related to Space Exploration from Fusion Energy Research. Making it easier available.
decouple-matter-processing-from-se=Removes any prerequisites related to Space Exploration from Matter Processing and Antimatter Reactor. Making it a lot easier accessible. NOTE: It will still require Fusion Energy Research, so it indirectly may still require some Space Exploration related research.
se-core-processing-input-count-apply-to-all-fragments=Allows the Basic Core Fragment Input Count to also apply to specialized Core Fragment processing. Low values with this activated significantly reduce the difficulty. Higher than normal values can increase the difficulty substancially.
singularity-beacon-upgrade=Changes the singularity beacon to be a strict upgrade over the Wide Area Beacon 2. Instead of a side grade.
adjust-core-mining-returns=Slightly modifies the core mining returns. Notably it grants a little more Uranium, Coal and Crude Oil.
