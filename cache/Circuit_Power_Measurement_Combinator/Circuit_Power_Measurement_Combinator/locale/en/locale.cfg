power-meter-combinator=Power Meter Combinator

[item-description]
power-meter-combinator=Combinator that reports power production stats for electric grid connected to nearby electric pole (max radius - 16 tiles), in kW. Each power producer item gets its own signal, plus special O signal for sum of non-item producers (some mods add these) and W signal for total production on the grid (sum of other signals). Can also be used as a constant combinator - feel free to set any extra signals there.

[mod-setting-name]
signal-update-interval=Signal Update Interval

[mod-setting-description]
signal-update-interval=Delay between updating signals on Power Meter Combinators, in Game Ticks (default 60 ticks = 1 second at 1x speed). Lower values might have impact on performance in a minor way (unless you use tens of thousands of them).
