[item-description]
scrap-fusion-reactor-equipment=A primitive fuel-burning power producer. Consumes burnable fuel, but provides steady, albeit low power.
scrap-hand-crank-equipment=What a stark contraption. A portable manual generator that provides constant, minimal power.
scrap-energy-shield-equipment=A crude electromagnetic shield. Will protect you from a few hits, but shouldn't be relied on.
scrap-battery-equipment=Small, roughly assembled capacitors bundled into a small storage pack. Unfortunately, the NightOps guys busted the blueprint. Stores a moderate amount of energy, but leaks a small amount.
scrap-personal-roboport-equipment=A cobbled together charging port with accompanying storage for a few bots.
scrap-construction-robot=Very basic construction automaton. Very fragile, slower than average, and incapable of going long without recharge.

[mod-setting-description]
scrappersdelight-disable-battery-drain=By default, the Leaky Capacitor leaks 5kW/sec energy. To make the battery drain power, its equipment type had to be changed to belt-immunity-equipment. Functionally, the battery works identically to any other battery, charging when energy is in excess and charging other equipment when necessary, however, the changed equipment type means that even though the battery still works the same, it doesn't visibly display the exact numbers of its energy storage. It only displays the green bar of its buffer. If this is inconvenient, this option can be checked to disable the energy drain on the Leaky Capacitor and change the capacitor from belt-immunity-equipment back to battery-equipment so it displays its exact energy value.
scrappersdelight-enable-manual-generator=If checked, enables the Manual Generator, which infinitely produces power like the fusion reactor, but only produces 10kW to keep it from overshadowing other power methods like solar equipment. If you feel it still overlaps too much with solar, it can be disabled with this setting.
