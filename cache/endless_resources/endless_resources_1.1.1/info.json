Includes modded ores, crude oil and modded liquids. Works in multiplayer and in games with multiple surfaces. In contrary to most other endless resource mods, this one does not convert the numbers on the ore patches to percentages and therefore still has ore patches change their size every now and then and let miners show the correct ratios.", "factorio_version": "1.1", "dependencies": ["base >= 1.1.0"]}
