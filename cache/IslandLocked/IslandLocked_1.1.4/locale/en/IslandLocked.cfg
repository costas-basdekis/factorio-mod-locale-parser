islandlocked-disable-darkstar-terratech=Setting has no effect if Darkstar Utilities not enabled.
islandlocked-disable-darkstar-jackhammers=Setting has no effect if Darkstar Utilities not enabled.
islandlocked-change-dmr-research-to-vanilla=DMR normally uses tenemut (and derivatives) for researching replication recipes. Checking this setting switches those technologies to be unlocked with regular science packs and removes replication labs.
islandlocked-initial-replicator-no-tenemut=DMR normally uses tenemut (and derivatives) as a required ingredient for creating all replicators.  Checking this setting makes the first replicator not require tenemut...useful for adding DMR/replication ability to maps that have not generated any tenemut; but only when vanilla science is used for DMR as well.
