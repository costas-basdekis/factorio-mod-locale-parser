[mod-setting-description]
supply-drop-time-between-drop-min=Minimum time between Supply crate drops, in minutes.
supply-drop-time-between-drop-max=Maximum time between Supply crate drops, in minutes.
supply-drop-distance-to-crate=Maximum distance away from the chosen player that the crate will spawn, in tiles. Set to a higher number to make the chest harder to find.
supply-drop-items-per-chest-max='Cycles' of the loot generator run per crate spawned at maximum. If duplicates are on and the loot generator picks the same item twice, you'll end up with a lot.
supply-drop-items-per-chest-min='Cycles' of the loot generator run per crate spawned at minimum. If duplicates are on and the loot generator picks the same item twice, you'll end up with a lot.
supply-drop-allow-duplicates=If enabled, allows duplicates in supply crates. Off by default, note that enabling can cause you to receive way too much of something, or just get boring chests of few items.
supply-drop-use-time-multiplier=If enabled, counts of items in crates will be increased slightly over time, based on how long the save's been going. See the FAQ on the mod page for the formula. Additive to other multipliers.
supply-drop-multiplier-per-player=Amount to multiply crate contents by per player past 1. For example, by default, having 2 players would result in a 1.25x multiplier to all crate contents. Additive to other multipliers. Set to 0 to disable.
supply-drop-flat-multiplier=Allows further tweaking of values if you feel the mod's giving you too much or too little. Multiplicative, not additive. Be careful. If you have a problem with a specific item count, post a suggestion.
supply-drop-damages-area-on-entry=If enabled, supply crates will damage all entities in the area they land in, potentially destroying machines. Disabled by default, enable for realism/masochism.
supply-drop-notify-players-on-enable=If enabled, whenever a new item is obtained and it becomes available to drop in supply crates, the mod will notify all players. I don't think it's needed, but hey, here you go if you want.
supply-drop-visual-effects=Set to what you'd like to appear when a chest is dropped. By default, the mod will spawn a large explosion, harmless fire, and put a little message in chat about hearing a noise.
supply-drop-oversized-drop-overflows=If enabled, oversized drops that exceed one crate worth of inventory will overflow into more crates nearby. When disabled, the items that don't fit are lost.
