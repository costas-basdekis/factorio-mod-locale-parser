[mod-name]
dyson-sphere=SLP - Dyson Sphere

[mod-description]
dyson-sphere=Generate 1TW (1000GW) of energy by creating a megastructure-the Dyson sphere. (Attention, creating a Dyson sphere leads to the disappearance of light in the entire star system!). This mod required for any SLP Mods (or you can try generate such energy by yourself, good luck)

[technology-description]
ds-megastructure-technology=Technology for creating a megastructure
ds-energy-loader=Open Dyson Sphere megastructure
ds-energy-interface=Open a holographic projector to monitor the state of the Dyson sphere
ds-entangled-core=Technology for transmitting energy over vast distances, and perhaps not just energy. It has great potential, for example, in megastructures.
