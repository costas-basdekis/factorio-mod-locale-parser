Destroyer Robots now seek and destroy discovered biter nests (worms and nests). Defender Units will either follow the player or defend the base in case of an enemy attack (toggle-able). Distractor Units have been renamed to Sentry Units to better describe their purpose. They now act as cheap semi-mobile turrets"}
