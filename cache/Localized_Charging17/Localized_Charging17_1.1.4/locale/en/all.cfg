[technology-description]
voltage-electric-trains=Higher powered trains that run off of electric batteries.
voltage-wireless-energy-distribution=A powerful charging system that will charge nearby power armor and certain electric vehicles at between 2.5 and 20MW/s, depending on the charging pole used. It will use twice the amount charged because the charging is inefficient.
