[technology-description]
intermediate-nuclear-technology=Allows you to build Breeder reactors that run on U-238 and research other nuclear technologies.
crude-uranium-processing=Allows you to process uranium ore into U-238 and U-235, albeit somewhat wastefully.
portable-breeder-reactor=Make a small reactor to power your gadgets, but remember to keep it topped up with U-238.
crude-enrichment=You can now use your excess U-238 and a bit of U-235 to get the chance to produce more U-235. Pretty slow though.
dirty-bomb=Not a true nuclear bomb, it merely uses radioactive elements to make a conventional explosive poison the surroundings.
RTG=Uses the waste output from a breeder reactor to make a small generator for your equipment that doesn't rely on refueling. Not very high power output though.
nuclear-fuel=Use the waste output from a breeder reactor to craft nuclear fuel for all you traditional burner fueled needs.
mini-nuke=The smallest you can make a true nuclear bomb, it is extremely deadly, but the explosion is small compered to a conventional nuke.
