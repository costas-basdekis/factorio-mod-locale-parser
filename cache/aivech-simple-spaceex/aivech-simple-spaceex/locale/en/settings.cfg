aivech-ssx-gate-electricity=Gate electricity behind AAI burner research
aivech-ssx-aai-recipes=Use AAI intermediates in vanilla recipes
aivech-ssx-offshore-pump=Offshore pump requires electricity

aivech-ssx-low-density-structure=Method of reconciling low-density structure
aivech-ssx-cheaper-landfill=Use Space Exploration stone landfill recipe
aivech-ssx-modules=Use Space Exploration modules recipes
aivech-ssx-expensive-nuke=Use Space Exploration atomic bomb recipe
aivech-ssx-equipment-research=Gate tier 2 power armor equipment behind adv. space science
aivech-ssx-safe-rockets=Make cargo rockets completely safe. WARNING: Turning this on will freeze your game for several seconds.
[mod-setting-description]
aivech-ssx-gate-electricity=If enabled, electricity generation will be gated behind the use of AAI burner machines.
aivech-ssx-aai-recipes=If enabled, AAI intermediate products (small electric engine, single-cylinder engine, glass, etc.) will be used in vanilla recipes.
aivech-ssx-offshore-pump=If enabled, the offshore pump will require electricity.
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure=Select the recipe to use for low-density structure.
aivech-ssx-cheaper-landfill=Landfill costs 50 stone instead of the vanilla 20
aivech-ssx-modules=Space Exploration module recipes are much cheaper
aivech-ssx-expensive-nuke=Space Exploration nuke recipe is much more expensive
aivech-ssx-equipment-research=Equipment will be effectively gated behind exploring other planets
aivech-ssx-safe-rockets=WARNING: This is a hack, and will freeze the game for several seconds when turned on. Use at your own risk.

aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-ignore=Use AAI recipe
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-replace=Use replacement item
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-revert=Use vanilla recipe
[string-mod-setting-description]
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-ignore=Low-density structure will use the Space Exploration recipe.
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-replace=Vanilla recipes will use __ITEM__composite-structure__ composite structure, made with the vanilla recipe. Low-density structure will use the Space Exploration recipe.
aivech-ssx-low-density-structure-revert=Low-density structure will use the vanilla recipe.
