The mod plans drills preferring longevity over initial speed, merges output into full belts, connects them with poles and pipes respecting obstacles.\nThe script can be used from command line for unmodded saves.\nAim: Blueprints based outposts result in numerous drills that will deplete quickly. Manaully removing useless drills, fixing obstacle issues and making a good merger is tedious after a while. Automating this process allows you to focus on other aspects of the game."}
