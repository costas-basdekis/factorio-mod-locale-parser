advanced-leaf-cooker-dl=Building on the success of the leaf cooker, the advanced leaf cooker has a few upgrades that improves speeed, while not exactly solving any problems regarding odor. 


greenhouse-pods-dl=Researching the greenhouse pods opens up the possibility of growing your own coca plants and harvesting your own coca leaves. Coca leaves are harvested from the Erythroxylaceae plant, that is a native plant of the Andes region in South America. Modern cocaine production is based on the same exact plant, the Erythroxylaceae. As the plant is adapted to high altitude, it is impossible to grow coca plants in normal fields. Our solution is to grow them in an artificial biosphere, where the high altitude dynamics are emulated by thinning the air. We simply add nitrogen to lower the oxygen percentage to 75 % of normal levels, so that oxygen is at just above 15% of the air inside the pods.





ash-production-dl=To the casual observer ash is just a waste product. But in reality ash is a valuable chemical product as it can be processed into potassium. Potassium is our main base or akaline in both potassium-hydroxide and potassium-nitrate. At a more advanced stage this leads to production of the powerful oxidizer potassium permanganate (when combined with manganese products) using the more advanced technologies. 


drug-furnace-dl=The use of a specialized drug furnace makes the basis for akaline chemistry as it provides ash from burned wood. The process also yields charcoal which is used as an agent for water purification. The drug furnace also has functionality that lets your strip copper wire from wooden poles before burning them, making the process more friendly for the environment and more economic in terms of resources.

basic-bitumen-dl=Adds the basic necessary technology for mining and processing tar sands into bitumen and various late stage products. The main attraction in bitumen technology is synthetic crude oil production, but there are many lesser uses too. The most important is simple use of bitumen as a fuel, but asphalt and pavement are other important uses in early stages of development. The use of a specialized drug furnace also makes the basis for akaline chemstry as it provides ash from burned wood that can be processed into potassium. At a more advanced stage this leads to production of the powerful oxidizer potassium permanganate (when combined with manganese products) using the more advanced technologies. 

basic-bitumen2-dl=wha?

limestone-dl=Besides the use of limestone in products like asphalt, the significance of limestone is again in akaline chemistry: Limedust act as a powerful agent in disolving organic matter and purifying chemical agents. The production of cocaine relies heavily on the supply of limedust as a reactant.

pneumatics-dl=Basic technology for air compression is the basis for nitrogen extraction.

nitrogen-chemistry-dl=Nitrogen chemistry gives you access to advanced chemical processing. By separating nitrogen from compressed air, a range of fertilizer products are made possible. This also has obvious implications for the production of gunpowder and explosives. The main use is however in supercharging plant production with fertilizing agents like ammonium-nitrate and ammonium-sulfate.

electrolysis-dl=Electrolysis is the separation of elements by use of electrical forces. This is useful when elements are needed that are naturally occurring in a combined element like sodium chloride (NaCl aka table salt). 

advanced-nitrogen-chemistry-dl=Advanced nitrogen chemistry lets you produce a range of fertilizer products. The main use point of this is that fertilizing agents like ammonium-nitrate and ammonium-sulfate lets you supercharge plant production. In essence you are powering plant growth with energy derived from burning fossil fuels, from solar or even from nuclear energy sources. 

advanced-potassium-chemistry-dl=

deepdrill-dl=Deep drill mining: The use of advanced drilling technology opens the potential for extracting minerals from deep wells. The main uses are in sulfur chemistry and in the processing of rhodochrosite into manganese proper. The use of the deepdrill as a source of ground water is constricted by economic considerations, but still has use as a specialized niche production. 

chemistry-3-dl=With advanced chemistry comes powerful oxidizers and the ability to crystalize cocaine hydrocloride from solution. Manganese is converted to manganese dioxide and later to potassium permanganate. The use of these oxidizers form the backbone of the advanced drug production. 

petrochem-three-dl=The pertrochem module builds on early experience with bitument processing: Using a blend of bitumen and light oil, artificial crude oil is produced. This will supplement your needs for oil based products like plastic, solid fuel and napalm. 

coca-leaves-dl=coca leaves are harvested from the Erythroxylaceae, that is a native plant of the Andes region in South America. Pharmaceuticaly prepared cocaine is a refined version of what has traditionally been used by the native population as a mild stimulant. References to chewing coca-leaves goes back to ancient times, and seems to have been an ingrained part of Indian culture there. Modern cocaine production is based on the same exact plant, the Erythroxylaceae. As the plant is adapted to high altitude, it is impossible to grow coca plants in normal fields. The Factorio DrugLab solution to this is to grow them in an artificial biosphere, where the high altitude dynamics are emulated by thinning the air. This is done simply by add nitrogen to lower the oxygen percentage to 75 % of normal levels, so that oxygen is at just above 15% of the air inside the pods. 

petrochem-one-dl=Key to the use of tar sand and bitumen products is the use of high temperature steam cracking and thus transforming long chain carbohydrates into a variety of shorter/lighter fractions. Steam cracking lets refine any mixed weight oil product into various fractions. This allows the production of kerosine (essential for drug production) as well as other petrochem products.
