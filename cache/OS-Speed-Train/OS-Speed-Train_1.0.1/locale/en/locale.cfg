speed-train=A pretty expensive and fast train.
speed-cargo-wagon=I think it's not as much overpowered as I could have made it.
speed-train-fuel=A neat little fluid which let your trains pass their speed limit, but its weight slows the acceleration...

speed-train=To my dear friend Dr Brown...
speed-train-fuel=A leak!

[technology-description]
speed-train=With those science packs, the thefts are paid to steal a flux capacitor from Dr Brown. With this piece of good level technology, it should be possible to create trains and cargo wagon which could pass the restriction of space and time!
speed-train-fuel=As the stolen flux capacitor was unintentionally damaged by one of the thefts, some fluid leaked. After some test, we noticed that this fluid can be purified and used as super fuel.
