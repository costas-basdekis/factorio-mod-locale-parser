As you neared your destination a terrible malfunctioned occured and the landing was rougher than anticipated. This minor setback threatens the mission, but failure is not an option. After assessing the damage to the ship you find the black box to figure out what went wrong. It seems the ship AI sensed imminent danger and enacted emergency ejection safety protcols to attempt to save what it could from the ship and treated the crew as secondary, corporate will be hearing from me on that one. The cabin crew managed to eject in escape pods before the ship exploded. Most of the tools and equipment were destroyed in the explosion, but maybe we can still use some energy from the shipwreck and try to build a temporary base of operation to assess our options.

page_mission_name_M_research_msi_protomolecule_awaken=Holly crap! What in the name of Factorion just happened? Did David just get absorbed by that thing? What is going on? And what are those things attacking us ? They look like David! Is it being replicated ? What is going on?\n\nCareful, that thing looks instable. We should try to release David from that...\n\nWe need to undertand what happened. If we could research [technology=msi_protomolecule_awaken] this molecule sample on our laboratories we may discover how to deal with that threat.

page_mission_name_M_research_msi_protomolecule_antidote_bomb=So we managed to kill that huge protomolecule infected nest! That is good news. The bad news is that the infection has spread so fast all around it and the thing is now everywhere! We need to research a way to fight the infection. So lets concentrate on developing a biological weapon to purge the threat for good. If we could launch it from a bomb on the the atmosphere, that could hit them all at once. We need to research the protomolecule antidote bomb [img=item/msi_protomolecule_antidote_bomb] and launch it on a rocket!
