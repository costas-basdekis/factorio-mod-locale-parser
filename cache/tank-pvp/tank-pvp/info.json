No mod required. Using headless server for hosting is recommended.\nPeriodic saving is unnecessary. No need to manage players. It's okay to leave it running it without care.\nYou can host this from your client but it's unfair if you join in fighting due to ping issues.\n\nI'm not the author, all credits to x2605 (https://github.com/x2605)", "source": "https://github.com/x2605/factorio-tank-pvp", "factorio_version": "1.1"}
