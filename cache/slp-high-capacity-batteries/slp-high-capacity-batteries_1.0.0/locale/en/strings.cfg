[technology-description]
slp-hcb-tech1=Discover a way to transport energy over a distance in convenient batteries! However, until you have learned even the technology of energy conservation, all you can to do is charge the water.
slp-hcb-tech2=Now you can charge not only water, but also normal batteries!
slp-hcb-tech3=A more balanced distribution of the charged liquid provides 10 times more stored energy.
slp-hcb-tech4=This is it! Pure energy right inside the energy retention capsule!
