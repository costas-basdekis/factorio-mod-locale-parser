[mod-setting-description]
ers-utility-science-pack-update=Default is true. Changes the recipe to better fit with the new science packs.
ers-enable-chemical-science-pack-mk0=Default is true.
ers-enable-military-science-pack-mk0=Default is true.
ers-enable-production-science-pack-mk0=Default is true.
ers-enable-utility-science-pack-mk0=Default is true.
ers-enable-new-science-pack-insertion=Default is true. The new science packs will be used as ingredients of the unlockeable techs. Useful, when some mods heavily changes the technology tree.
ers-enable-science-pack-upgrades=Default is true. Advanced tiers of science packs now can be crafted using the previous tier of science pack. Recipes still uses the normal ingredients too.
ers-krastorio2-utility-science-pack-update=Default is true. Changes the recipe to better fit with the new tech cards.
ers-krastorio2-basic-tech-card-new-tiers=Default is true. Enables some new tiers for the 'Basic tech card'.
ers-krastorio2-tech-card-override=Default is true. Add 'Blank tech card' as ingredients to the new 'Tech cards' as well the first tier tech cards, when the vanilla 'Factorio' recipes are used.
ers-bobmods-logistic-science-pack-update=Default is true. Changes Bob's 'Logistic science pack' recipe to better fit with the new science packs. It becomes an upgrade to 'Logistic science pack MKIII'.
