recipescaling-recipe-multiplier=Number of equivalent crafting processes.\nAffects crafting time, ingredients, products.\nStill limited by stack sizes.
recipescaling-recipe-category-exclude=__ITEM__Schall-multiple-pattern-note__Default: "rocket-building, creative-mod_*, Schall-radioactive-incineration"

recipescaling-recipe-time-threshold=Only recipes faster than threshold get scaled.\nUse a high value, if preferring to have every scaled recipes.\nDefault: 360
recipescaling-recipe-set-usable=Affect included machines (by above options) only.\nOther machines can still use the original set only.
recipescaling-machine-scaled-only-include=Only applied when "Both scaled & original sets" is selected above.\nIncluded machines use scaled recipes only.  Use on machines where recipe cannot be assigned (e.g., furnaces).\n__ITEM__Schall-multiple-pattern-note__Default: "*furnace-MS-[3456789]$"

SchallRecipeScaling=Schall Recipe Scaling

[mod-description]
SchallRecipeScaling=Adds scaled up version of recipes, in order to get around the game limitation (60 crafting per second) faced by very high speed machines.  This allows for true mass production under healthy UPS.\nDesigned for supporting scaled up machines from “Schall Machine Scaling” mod.
