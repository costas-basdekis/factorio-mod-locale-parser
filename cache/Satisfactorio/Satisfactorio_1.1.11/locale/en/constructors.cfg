[entity-description]
craft-bench=Allows you to manually craft a large range of different parts. These parts can then be used in the construction of different factory buildings, vehicles and equipment.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Requires manual interaction.[/color][/font]
equipment-workshop=Used to manually craft equipment.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Requires manual interaction.[/color][/font]
smelter=Smelts ore into ingots. Can be automated by feeding ore into it with a conveyor belt connected to the input. The produced ingots can be automatically extracted by connecting a conveyor belt to the output.
foundry=Smelts two ore resources into ingots. Can by automated by feeding ore into it with a conveyor belt connected to the inputs. The produced ingots can be automatically extracted by connecting a conveyor belt to the output.
constructor=Crafts one part into another part. Can be automated by feeding parts into it with a conveyor belt connected to the input. The produced parts can be automatically extracted by connecting a conveyor belt to the output.
assembler=Crafts two parts into another part. Can be automated by feeding parts into it with a conveyor belt connected to the input. The produced parts can be automatically extracted by connecting a conveyor belt to the output.
manufacturer=Crafts three or four parts into another part. Can be automated by feeding parts into it with a conveyor belt connected to the input. The produced parts can be automatically extracted by connecting a conveyor belt to the output.
refinery=Refines fluid and/or solid parts into other parts. Contains both a conveyor belt and pipe inputs and outputs, to allow for the automation of various recipes.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10
blender=The Blender is capable of blending fluids and combining them with solid parts in various processes. Contains both conveyor belt and pipe inputs and outputs.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10
particle-accelerator=The FICSIT Particle accelerator uses electromagnetic fields to propel particles to very high speeds and energies. The specific design allows for a variety of processes, such as matter generation and conversion.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]WARNING:[/color][/font] Power usage is extremely high, unstable, and varies per recipe.
packager=Used for the packaging and unpacking of fluids. Contains both a conveyor belt and pipe inputs and outputs, to allow for the automation of various recipes.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10
