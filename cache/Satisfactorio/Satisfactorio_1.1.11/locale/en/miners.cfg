[entity-description]
portable-miner=Can be set up on a resource node to automatically extract the resource. Very limited storage space.
miner-mk-1=Extracts solid resources from the resource node it is built on.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Base extraction rate:[/color][/font] 30 resources per minute.\nThe extraction rate is modified depending on resource purity. Outputs all extracted resources onto connected conveyor belts.
miner-mk-2=Extracts solid resources from the resource node it is built on.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Base extraction rate:[/color][/font] 60 resources per minute.\nThe extraction rate is modified depending on resource purity. Outputs all extracted resources onto connected conveyor belts.
miner-mk-3=Extracts solid resources from the resource node it is built on.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Base extraction rate:[/color][/font] 120 resources per minute.\nThe extraction rate is modified depending on resource purity. Outputs all extracted resources onto connected conveyor belts.
water-extractor=Extracts water from the body of water it is built on.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Normal extraction rate:[/color][/font] 120m³ per minute.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10
oil-extractor=Can be built on an Oil node to extract Crude Oil.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Base extraction rate:[/color][/font] 60m³ per minute.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10\nThe extraction rate is modified depending on resource purity.
resource-well-pressuriser=Can be placed on a resource well to activate it by pressurising the underground resource. Once activated, Extractors can be placed on the surrounding sub-nodes to extract the resource.
resource-well-extractor=Can be placed on the activated sub-nodes of a resource well to collect the pressurised resources.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Base extraction rate:[/color][/font] 30m³ per minute.\n[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Max. recommended pipe length:[/color][/font] 10\nThe extraction rate is modified depending on resource purity.
