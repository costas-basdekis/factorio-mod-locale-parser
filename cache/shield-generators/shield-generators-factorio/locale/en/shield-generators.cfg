[technology-description]
shield-generators-basics=Research fundamentals of energy shields
shield-generators-turret-shields-basics=Every turret receive it's own energy shield, which protect it from small attacks. Recharge rate is slow, so this shield won't hold for long.
shield-generators-turret-shield-capacity=Increases internal energy shield battery capacity of turrets, allowing energy shields to work for longer under sustained fire or in periouds of blackout.
shield-generators-turret-shield-speed=Increases speed at which turret energy shields recharge, allowing turret to take focused fire for longer periods.
shield-generators-provider-shield-speed=Increases speed at which energy shields generators recharge, allowing protected factories to take focused fire for longer periods.
shield-generators-turret-shield-input=Increases speed at which internal batteries of turret energy shields recharge, allowing energy shield to recharge internal batteries quicker.

shield-generators-provider-shields-basics=Weak energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a small factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-advanced=Energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a medium factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-elite=Strong energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a large factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-ultimate=Ultimate energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a enormous factory from enemy attacks.

shield-generators-superconducting-shields=Allows shields from generators to take more damage before exhausting.

shield-generators-provider-range-advanced=Advanced shield generator range
shield-generators-provider-range-elite=Elite shield generator range
shield-generators-provider-range-ultimate=Ultimate shield generator range

shield-generators-delay=Recharge speed delay for shields
shield-generators-max-time=Recharge speed max idle time
shield-generators-max-speed=Max formation speed multiplier

[mod-setting-description]
shield-generators-delay=Time in seconds before shield start to form faster after taking damage. Think of Medi-Gun from Team Fortress 2 if you don't understand this explanation
shield-generators-max-time=Time in seconds before chield reach full form speed after delay. Formation speed raise linearly
shield-generators-max-speed=When shield reach `shield-generators-self-max-time` seconds after `shield-generators-self-delay`, regular recharge speed is multiplied by this value

shield-generators-keep-interfaces=DISABLING this option is experimental! Disabling this option will make the mod remove energy-interface technical entities of turret shields when they are idling. In 99% of situations, this is not something you want to disable, unless your base have more than 10k turrets, in which case energy-interface update time inside Electric network starts being distinguishable. This option has major technical and gameplay downsides and DO NOT disable it unless you exactly know what you are doing!!!\n\nIf this option is disabled, shield power switch won't do anything
