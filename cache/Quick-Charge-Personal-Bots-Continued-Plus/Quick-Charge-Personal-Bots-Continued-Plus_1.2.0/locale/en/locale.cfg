[mod-setting-description]
personal-robot-charging-is-free-qcpb=If this is false, charging will be quick but not free.
update-interval-qcpb=This settings determines how often (in ticks) the script to add energy will run.
charging-energy-qcpb=This modifies the speed at which the personal roboport charges worker robots
input-flow-limit-qcpb=This modifies the speed at which the personal roboport buffer fills.
buffer-capacity-qcpb=This modifies how large the personal roboport energy buffer is.
