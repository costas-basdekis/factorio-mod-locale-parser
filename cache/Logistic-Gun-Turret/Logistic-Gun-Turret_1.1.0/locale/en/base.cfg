[technology-description]
logistic-turrets=This research unlocks Turret Buffer and Turret Interface, which can be placed on any ammo turret or artillery turret to restock it with ammo defined in it's requester slots. By default turrets will automatically have a ghost blueprint for a Turret Interface placed on them.

[mod-setting-name]
lgt-request-from-buffers=Request from buffers
lgt-loaded-magazines=Loaded magazines (1-10)
lgt-early-available=Early available
lgt-auto-interface=Auto interface
lgt-broadcast--request-slots=Broadcast request slots setup
lgt-reloading-period=Reloading period (60-300 ticks)

[mod-setting-description]
lgt-default-requested-items=Default number of items requested by logistic interface.
lgt-request-from-buffers=If set to true, all interfaces will automatically be set to request ammo from buffers. False lets you customize each interface.
lgt-loaded-magazines=The amount of ammo to keep in each turret. As the mod only checks each turret once every two seconds, having this too low can cause turrets to run out before the next reload. Note: 2 is enougth for vanilla turrets with even max shooting speed, but may not be enougth for modded turrets.
lgt-early-available=If true the logistic turret research is substantially easier and turret interfaces are cheaper as well.
lgt-auto-interface=Whether placed turrets should automatically blueprint a turret interface upon placement.
lgt-broadcast--request-slots=When set to true, changing any interface request slot will broadcast setup to other interfaces on the same logistic network. Newly created interface will also receive default setup from logistic network if any.
lgt-reloading-period=During this period all turrets will be triggered once to eventually reload.
