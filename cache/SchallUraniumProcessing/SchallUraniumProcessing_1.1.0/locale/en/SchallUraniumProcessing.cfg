uranium-concentrate=Uranium concentrate
uranium-238=Depleted uranium
uranium-low-enriched=Low enriched uranium
uranium-235=Highly enriched uranium

[item-description]
uranium-concentrate=Also known as “yellowcake”.  Uranium ore after filtering and drying, turns to uranium oxide concentrate.  Contains natural level of about 0.7% uranium-235.
uranium-238=Contains no uranium-235.
uranium-low-enriched=Reactor-grade uranium.  Contains about 3.5% - 5% uranium-235.
uranium-235=Weapons-grade uranium.  Contains about 90% uranium-235.

[technology-description]
uranium-processing=Uranium ore is processed into uranium concentrate, then enriched in centrifuges to higher concentrations of uranium-235 to create uranium fuel cells.

[mod-setting-name]
uraniumprocessing-remove-kovarex-enrichment-process=Remove Kovarex enrichment process
uraniumprocessing-remove-sulfuric-acid-mining=Remove need of mining fluid
uraniumprocessing-modify-nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=Modify nuclear fuel reprocessing
uraniumprocessing-uranium-238-colour-change=Colour change __ITEM__uranium-238__

[mod-setting-description]
uraniumprocessing-remove-kovarex-enrichment-process=Since there are much more realistic uranium processes already added by this mod, Kovarex enrichment process is no longer essential.  But it is the only way (though unrealistic or "cheaty") to get rid of the excess uranium-238, especially for players who do not produce uranium ammo and cannon shells.
uraniumprocessing-remove-sulfuric-acid-mining=Sulfuric acid is no longer required in mining uranium ore, but is used in uranium processing (preparation of uranium concentrate “yellowcake”) instead.  This is more accurate to how it is done in reality.\nAlso change the recipe category of uranium concentrate, since centrifuge does not accept fluid.
uraniumprocessing-uranium-238-colour-change=To better distinguish from __ITEM__uranium-low-enriched__ (green).\n"Unchanged": Vanilla setting.  Dark green.\n"Grey (HSL)": Grayscale with HSL.\n"Grey (HSV)": Grayscale with HSV.

[mod-description]
SchallUraniumProcessing=Separate pure uranium-235 and pure uranium-238 items?  Real-world nuclear industry do NOT work like that!\nThis mod introduces more realistic uranium items of different grades and more realistic uranium enrichment processing.\nRecipes are kept simple, so even vanilla players will find this easy to master with.
