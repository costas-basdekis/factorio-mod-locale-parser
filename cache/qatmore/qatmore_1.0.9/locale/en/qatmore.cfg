[mod-setting-description]
qatmods-alien-price-down=Set to match technology price multiplier. Or whatever integer you like. You may see rounding errors in prices if you set a number whose inverse has infinite digits, i.e. 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, etc.
qatmods-alien-research-up=Alien research packs will have a more complex recipe involving a couple chemical ingredients. Infinite alien research will now require a new platinum research pack.
qatmods-amethyst-modules=Bob's modules use amethysts instead of emeralds to better balance gem usage.
qatmods-cheaper-artifacts=Price of converting small alien artifacts to large is decreased from 25 to 10. This is meant to help with alternative enemy mods like Rampant where artifacts are much more scarce.
qatmods-enhanced-early-ammo=Early ammo recipes will have increased complexity. Bob's Greenhouse recommended.
qatmods-experimental-faster-pipes=More advanced pipes should now be able to transport more fluid. This has not been exhaustively tested yet.
qatmods-finite-hydrogen=Adjusts recipes so that water electrolysis will not give more energy in the form of hydrogen fuel than was needed to produce the hydrogen (unless using modules). This setting can be used with or without Bob's Expensive Electrolysis enabled (both is recommended), with recipes re-adjusted to account for the differences between the two. This setting on its own does not change the energy demand of electrolysers, which will make aluminium and titanium cheaper to produce. Also increases rocket fuel cost for the same reason.
qatmods-gold-not-fluid=Gold will use sodium cyanide for processing instead of mining. This is not the intended production chain and is significantly more expensive.
qatmods-gold-revision=Gold mining/processing will now use sodium cyanide as a solvent.
qatmods-impure-water=Ground water will be regular water instead of pure water. Try disabling bodies of water and using landfill on the single lake in your starting area as a challenge run.
qatmods-less-basic-belts=Switches yellow-tier underground belts and splitters to require yellow belts instead of their gray downgrades, thus avoiding the need for wood and copper wire in these production chains.
qatmods-lithium-lubricant=Adds a small amount of lithium to lubricant, in order to expand the number of things lithium is used for.
qatmods-nickel-from-iron=Adds a new method to extract nickel from iron ore, similar to the process for getting cobalt from copper, eliminating the need to mine nickel. Nickel ore patches will remain on the map, but they can be disabled without issue on the Resources tab when starting a new game. NOTE: This setting blocks meteoric iron from spawning from "Special rare ores".
qatmods-nuclear-enhancement=Increases complexity of nuclear recipes, including new uses for the centrifuge. NOTE: All nuclear changes from this mod will be disabled if the Nuclear fuel update in Bob's Metals, Chemicals and Intermediates mod is not active.
qatmods-nuclear-enhancement-2=Makes adjustments to nuclear power, and adds americium, curium, and californium synthesis to the centrifuge. These are used in personal power equipment and other nuclear things. NOTE: All nuclear changes from this mod will be disabled if the Nuclear fuel update in Bob's Metals, Chemicals and Intermediates mod is not active.
qatmods-ore-stack=Sets stack size of raw ores. Default for Bob's is 200, base game is 50.
qatmods-oxygen-from-quartz=Adds oxygen gas as a byproduct of silicon electrolysis to help balance increased demand for sulfuric acid.
qatmods-pierce-enhancement=Changes non-explosive tank shells to do piercing damage and lowers high-level enemies' resistance to pierce.
qatmods-plasma-nerf=Make plasma cannons and personal lasers a little less insanely overpowered so that attackers can pose at least some challenge.
qatmods-rare-ores=Resource spawner overhaul mod is strongly recommended due to the vanilla game having a lower limit for resource rarity. Adds: Meteoric iron-nickel (NOTE: blocked by the "Recipe: nickel from iron" setting, set that to false); cryolite, low in quantity but cheaper than bauxite, also gives sodium and fluorine; okloite, gives uranium and heavier elements (only with "Nuclear enhancement 2" setting on); and chalcopyrite, gives iron, copper, zinc, and sulfur.
qatmods-silver-blue=For Bob's Electronics: Blue circuit boards will use silver instead of gold. Note: With this option disabled, it is possible to run a base without any need to mine silver at all.
qatmods-small-assembler-color-shift=Machine shops and Electronics assembly machines will have slightly different colors to distinguish them from each other and from basic Assembly machines.
