[mod-setting-name]
keniras-realistic-power-item-costs=Cheap steam engines
keniras-realistic-power-bob-wafer=Solar panels require wafers (Bob's mods)
keniras-realistic-power-day-multiplier=Day length multiplier (if not using Clockwork)
keniras-realistic-power-solar-multiplier=Solar Power Multiplier

[mod-setting-description]
keniras-realistic-power-item-costs=Significantly decreases steam engine cost (back to normal). Other item costs, like nuclear reactors, are unaffected by this setting. Recommended when using marathon or similar mods / settings to accelerate the early game for impatient people. Default false.
keniras-realistic-power-bob-wafer=Solar panels need wafers from Bob's mods, if Bob's mods are installed. Default true.
keniras-realistic-power-day-multiplier=Only without Clockwork: Sets the multiplier for accumulator capacities. Default 205 (equivalent to 24h days)
keniras-realistic-power-solar-multiplier=Multiplier for power generated by solar panels. Default 0.18
