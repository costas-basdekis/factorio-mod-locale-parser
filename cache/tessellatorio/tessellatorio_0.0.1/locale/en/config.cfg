[technology-description]
tessellatorio-tessellation-size=Increases the size of the tessellation area by a factor of 2.
tessellatorio-tessellation-cardinal-size=Increases the number of tessellations by 1 in the cardinal directions
tessellatorio-tessellation-diagonal-size=Increases the number of tessellations by 1 in the diagonal directions

tessellatorio-tessellation-cardinal=Enables different tessellation patterns for the 4 cardinal directions
tessellatorio-tessellation-diagonal=Enables different tessellation patterns for the 4 diagonal directions


tessellatorio-tessellogistics=Unlocks a transport belt that doesn't follow tessellation, enabling fine control of individual tiles. These belts will be destroyed if something is placed over it in another tile.
tessellatorio-tessellogistics-4=Unlocks a roboport and logistics chests that don't follow tessellation.
