[mod-setting-description]
SeeNoEvil-1000-always_night_setting=The celestial mechanics have chaotic dynamics. A butterfly flapping its wings could knock a planet out of its orbit, into the empty vast empty space. The same goes for a douchebag crashing his spaceship after looking down at his phone while driving.
SeeNoEvil-2000-disable_alerts_setting=Disable alerts when entities get damaged or destroyed. Turrets firing will still alert.
SeeNoEvil-9000-prepare_uninstall=Resets the savefile in preparation for uninstalling.
