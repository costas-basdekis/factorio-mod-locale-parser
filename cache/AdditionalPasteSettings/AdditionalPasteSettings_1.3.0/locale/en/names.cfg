additional-paste-settings-hotkey=This should be SHIFT + Left Click for most users. This should ALWAYS be the hotkey that pastes settings on entities.
additional-paste-settings-hotkey-alt=This should be SHIFT + ALT + Left Click for most users. This key should 1/2 the current stack amount on an inserter.

additional-paste-settings-options-requester-multiplier-type=Let's you choose between considering by: how much the Item Stacks; based on how much the Recipe Consumes of each item type; or the Time Spent on crafting the item.
additional-paste-settings-options-requester-multiplier-value=Defines how much will be requested for logistic chests, depending on the Multiplier Type that was chosen. If Time was chosen, then this will be in seconds spent on crafting.
additional-paste-settings-options-inserter-multiplier-type=Let's you choose between considering by: how much the Item Stacks; based on how much the Recipe Consumes of each item type; or the Time Spent on crafting the item.
additional-paste-settings-options-inserter-multiplier-value=Defines how much will be requested for logistic chests, depending on the Multiplier Type that was chosen. If Time was chosen, then this will be in seconds spent on crafting.
additional-paste-settings-options-combinator-multiplier-type=Let's you choose between considering by: how much the Item Stacks; based on how much the Recipe Consumes of each item type; or the Time Spent on crafting the item.
additional-paste-settings-options-combinator-multiplier-value=Defines how much will be requested for logistic chests, depending on the Multiplier Type that was chosen. If Time was chosen, then this will be in seconds spent on crafting.
additional-paste-settings-options-sumup=Wether after pasting again over an entity that already has a setting pasted, if checked then the final value will be additive. If unchecked, then it will just set to the value.
additional-paste-settings-options-invert-buffer=If checked, instead of pasting into the buffer chest the ingredients, it will paste the recipe output. It's always based on how much the produced Item Stacks.
additional-paste-settings-options-invert-buffer-multiplier-value=Requires the option above to Invert Buffer mechanics to work. Defines how much will be requested for buffer chests, depending on how much the produced stacks.
