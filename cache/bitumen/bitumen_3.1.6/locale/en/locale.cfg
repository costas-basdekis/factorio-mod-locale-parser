[technology-description]
amm-catalysis=Artifical Methane Monooxoygenase Catalyst are emulations of natural enzymes found in nature. Methane monooxoygenase found in certain bacteria breaks down methane to methanol and the artificial version of this is based on palladium-oxide transfered to a nano grid of plast material.

catalysis=Catalysis is the process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by adding a substance known as a catalyst, which is not consumed in the catalyzed reaction and can continue to act repeatedly. Because of this, only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in principle.


napalmic-damage=Napalm damage


napalm-dl=Napalm fire warfare: While the locals can be a bit of a nuisance, nothing calms them down like a generous dose of burning napalm. The napalm flamethrower is a specialized weapon that takes advantage of the unique benefits of napalm. This is a vast improvement over the standard issued flamethrower using light oil as best available fuel: Longer range, longer lasting fire and more damage. Avoid carelessly wandering into the inferno that you have created as the burning napalm has a long lasting and very damaging effect on organic tissue.


solid-fuel-dl=One of the benefits of bitumen technology is the option to make petrochemical products in a solid form. The longchain carbohydrates makes it possible to blend a product with the desired viscoucity be it fluid, semi fluid or solid. Solid fuel have application in high density storage, in the production of high energy fuels and as a precursor in production of plastic materials. 

solid-fuel-2-dl=One of the benefits of bitumen technology is the option to make petrochemical products in a solid form. The longchain carbohydrates makes it possible to blend a product with the desired viscoucity be it fluid, semi fluid or solid. Solid fuel have application in high density storage, in the production of high energy fuels and as a precursor in production of plastic materials. 


steam-cracking-dl=Steam cracking is a petrochemical process in which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked through the use of steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.

advanced-plastics-dl=Advanced plastics production


petrochem-four-dl=Fracking technologies: Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas, petroleum, and brine will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants (either sand or aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open.


simple-petrocem-dl=Simple petrochem production: The pertrochem module builds on early experience with bitument processing: Using a blend of bitumen and light oil, artificial crude oil is produced. This will supplement your needs for oil based products like plastic, solid fuel and napalm.

greenhouse-pods-dl=Researching the greenhouse pods opens up the possibility of growing your own coca plants and harvesting your own coca leaves. Coca leaves are harvested from the Erythroxylaceae plant, that is a native plant of the Andes region in South America. Modern cocaine production is based on the same exact plant, the Erythroxylaceae. As the plant is adapted to high altitude, it is impossible to grow coca plants in normal fields. Our solution is to grow them in an artificial biosphere, where the high altitude dynamics are emulated by thinning the air. We simply add nitrogen to lower the oxygen percentage to 75 % of normal levels, so that oxygen is at just above 15% of the air inside the pods.





ash-production-dl=To the casual observer ash is just a waste product. But in reality ash is a valuable chemical product as it can be processed into potassium. Potassium is our main base or akaline in both potassium-hydroxide and potassium-nitrate. At a more advanced stage this leads to production of the powerful oxidizer potassium permanganate (when combined with manganese products) using the more advanced technologies. 


tar-furnace=The simple stone furnace makes the basis for akaline chemistry as it provides ash from burned wood. The process also yields charcoal which is used as an agent for water purification.

The main attraction in bitumen technology is synthetic crude oil production, but there are many lesser uses too. The most important is simple use of bitumen as a fuel, but asphalt and pavement are other important uses in early stages of development. 



yyyy=The use of a specialized furnace also makes the basis for akaline chemstry as it provides ash from burned wood that can be processed into potassium. At a more advanced stage this leads to production of the powerful oxidizer potassium permanganate (when combined with manganese products) using the more advanced technologies. 

basic-bitumen2-dl=wha?

limestone-dl=Besides the use of limestone in products like asphalt, the significance of limestone is again in akaline chemistry: Limedust act as a powerful agent in disolving organic matter and purifying chemical agents. The production of cocaine relies heavily on the supply of limedust as a reactant.

pneumatics-dl=Basic technology for air compression is the basis for nitrogen extraction.

nitrogen-chemistry-dl=While rocky planets could be expected to have only nitrogen sourced from the outer (and colder) parts of the protoplanetary disk, that is in fact not so. Analysis of nitroten-14 and nitrogen-15 isotope ratios shows that much of the average rocky planet will have mainly nitrogen from the hotter innner parts of the protoplantary disk of the early stages of planetary formation in the system. This explains the usually high abundance of nitrogen in the atmosphere of small rocky planets. Nitrogen chemistry gives you access to advanced chemical processing. By separating nitrogen from compressed air, a range of fertilizer products are made possible. This also has obvious implications for the production of gunpowder and explosives. The main use is however in supercharging plant production with fertilizing agents like ammonium-nitrate and ammonium-sulfate. 



electrolysis-dl=Electrolysis is the separation of elements by use of electrical forces. This is useful when elements are needed that are naturally occurring in a combined element like sodium chloride (NaCl aka table salt). 

advanced-nitrogen-chemistry-dl=Advanced nitrogen chemistry lets you produce a range of fertilizer products. The main use point of this is that fertilizing agents like ammonium-nitrate and ammonium-sulfate lets you supercharge plant production. In essence you are powering plant growth with energy derived from burning fossil fuels, from solar or even from nuclear energy sources. 

advanced-potassium-chemistry-dl=

deepdrill-dl=Deep drill mining: The use of advanced drilling technology opens the potential for extracting minerals from deep wells. The main uses are in sulfur chemistry and in the processing of rhodochrosite into manganese proper. The use of the deepdrill as a source of ground water is constricted by economic considerations, but still has use as a specialized niche production. 


petrochem-three-dl=The pertrochem module builds on early experience with bitumen processing: Using a blend of bitumen and light oil, artificial crude oil is produced. This will supplement your needs for oil based products like plastic, solid fuel and napalm. 



petrochem-one-dl=Key to the use of tar sand and bitumen products is the use of high temperature steam cracking and thus transforming long chain carbohydrates into a variety of shorter/lighter fractions. Steam cracking lets refine any mixed weight oil product into various fractions. 




[fluid-description]

ash=Ash. To the casual observer ash is just a waste product. But in reality ash is a valuable chemical product as it can be processed into potassium. Potassium is our main base or akaline in both potassium-hydroxide and potassium-nitrate. At a more advanced stage this leads to production of the powerful oxidizer potassium permanganate (when combined with manganese products) using the more advanced technologies. 

limestone-dl= Limestone. The basis for lime, your cheap run-of-the-mill alkaline. Besides the use of limestone in products like asphalt, the significance of limestone is again in akaline chemistry: Limedust act as a powerful agent in disolving organic matter and purifying chemical agents.

leaf-cooker= Slurry cooker. The Ambient Industries standard slurry cooker is known for its great realiability and endurance, but less so for its process speed. 

advanced-leaf-cooker=Advanced slurry cooker. While the Ambient Industries advanced slurry cooker has a wider range of functionality then the standard model, it is still not a satifying solution where fast or high yielding production is needed. 

charcoal=Charcoal. Burning off water and impurities at relative low temperatures produces a clean agent for water processing or futher purification. 

gunpowder=Gunpowder - First used by the anchient Chinese cultures, gunpowder was the first step on the road to mutually asured destruction (MAD) and other modern diplomacy enhancers.

leaf-washer=Simple slurry cooker. The simple slurry cooker is used in petrochem production for a variety of purposes.

leaf-washer2= Wooden slurry cooker. The wooden slurry cooker is a favorite tool for on-site chemical processing, if you dont care too much about purity, reliability, safety or pollution.


e=Salt - Also known as natriumcloride

sodium-hydroxide=Sodium hydroxide

cellulose=Cellulose


asphalt-dl=Asphalt - The one product that everybody recognises which is based on bitumen. Makes for a high friction and durable pavement. Used extensively to compensate for any eastetic shortcomings in your local environment. 

manganese-ore=Manganese ore - Manganese is a very common element, but extremely usefull in advanced oxidizers like potassium permanganate. 

woodchips=Woodchips - used for more effective burning than simple wood logs. 

greenhouse=Greenhouse - A greenhouse lets you control composition and temperature of the environment and thus maximize the growing conditions for a variety of plants.
 
advanced-furnace=The Carbon 3000 Furnace - A specialized tool for burning different kinds of wood, charcoal and ashes. The use of the specialized Carbon 3000 Furnace makes the basis for akaline chemistry as it provides ash from burned wood. The process also yields charcoal which is used as an agent for water purification. The Carbon 3000 Furnace also has functionality that lets your strip copper wire from wooden poles before burning them, making the process more friendly for the environment and more economic in terms of resources. 

wood-seedling=Wood seedling - used for growing threes if and when you have paved over the world and need ash from wood. 

sulfur= Sulfur - crude oil will often carry a fraction of sufur after being in cotact with certain deep layers of sediments. As shale rock based carbohydrates are not fluid, they dont carry any significant amounts of sulfur. 

activated-charcoal=Activated charcoal - a processed kind of charcoal that has an extremely huge surface area due to its specially porrous structure.



napalm-cartridge=Napalm canister - a cartridge like unit of higly flamable napalm.

napalmflamethrower= Napalm flamethrower - a usefull tool for calming down any agitated natives. One of the benefits of securing a stable high yield energy production is the variety of synthetic materials and products that petrochemical processing can provide. One prime example is the gel like substance known as napalm. This is based on a mixture of naphthenic acid and palmitic acid that can both be derived from different oil fractions.

napalm-turret= Napalm turret - normaly used to enhance your diplomatic efforts in relation to the local population
fracking-station-dl=Fracking station - used for extracting carbohydrates from shale rock layers deep undergroung.
sand-dl=Sand
gas-ammonia= Ammonia. Ammonia is named for the Ammonians, worshipers of the Egyptian god Amun, who used ammonium chloride in their rituals.
