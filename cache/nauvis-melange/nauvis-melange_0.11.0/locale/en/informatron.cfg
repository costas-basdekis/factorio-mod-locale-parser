text_welcome=Welcome to the Nauvis Melange mod. To get started on producing [img=item/nm-spice] __ITEM__nm-spice__, research [img=technology/nm-spice-processing] __ITEM__nm-spice__ processing.

text_spice-processing=To get hold of the [img=item/nm-spice] __ITEM__nm-spice__ you need to find a __ENTITY__nm-worm-hole__, which you can create by killing a worm or placing a __ITEM__nm-sandtrout-small__ (or any of its variants), or find one by sheer luck.\nAfter this you need to place a [img=item/nm-water-injector-proxy] __ENTITY__nm-water-injector__ on it and fill the hole with water. Once its full the __ENTITY__nm-water-injector__ will explode, leaving the __ITEM__nm-pre-spice-mass__ behind. This you can then simply mine.

text_alien-breeding=Breeding aliens is rather easy. Once researched, you can craft an [img=item/nm-alien-probe] __ITEM__nm-alien-probe__, which you then use near an alien to get a sample of their blood. This blood is then used in the __ENTITY__nm-alien-growth-chamber__ to grow an alien leech.

text_spacing-guild=To create navigators for diverse uses, you require a [img=technology/nm-spacing-guild] __ENTITY__nm-spacing-guild__ building. Additionaly it is needed to launch a rocket, as they control space travel. The [img=item/nm-spacing-guild] __ENTITY__nm-spacing-guild__ requires massive amounts of __ITEM__nm-spice__ gas to function, be prepared.
