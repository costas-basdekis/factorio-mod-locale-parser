[mod-setting-description]
ee-allow-changing-aggregate-chest-filters=By default, aggregate chest filters are unchangeable, because the mod will overwrite any changes whenever mod configuration changes. If you wish to be able to edit the filters despite this, check this option.
ee-controller-inventory_size=This option cannot be changed at runtime.\nAll of the below options are defaults, and can be changed at runtime via the map editor GUI.
ee-default-infinity-filters=Infinity filters that will be applied to your inventory when you enter the editor for the first time.\n[color=255,57,48]Change this from the main menu, otherwise it will not effect new games![/color]
ee-hijack-debug-world=Control + click the "Single player" button to spawn a new 50x50 freeplay world. This setting hijacks this debug world to replace it with lab tiles, research all technologies, and give you the EE loadout.
ee-infinity-pipe-crafter-snapping=When you place an infinity pipe directly next to a crafter fluid input, it will automatically set its filter to provide that fluid.
ee-inventory-sync=When in cheat mode, your inventory and cursor stack will be synced between the editor and normal play.
ee-prevent-initial-pause=Prevent the game pausing the simulation when you enter the editor for the first time. The paused state can be changed from the time editor menu.
ee-start-in-editor=Automatically enter the map editor when entering the debug world or testing scenario.\nDebug world requires "Hijack debug world" to be enabled.
ee-testing-lab=Automatically teleport to a testing lab when entering the map editor, then back out when you leave the editor. This allows you to easily test setups in an isolated space, while keeping your actual factory pristine. Choose between your own personal lab, and a lab shared among all players.\n\nDisabling inventory sync allows you to use this in a completely cheat-proof way in regular playthroughs.
