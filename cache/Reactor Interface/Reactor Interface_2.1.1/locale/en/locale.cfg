[entity-name]
reactor-interface=Nuclear reactor interface

[entity-description]
reactor-interface=Outputs information about the reactor to the circuit network and stops the reaction when [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-stop] is received.
nuclear-reactor=Uses uranium fuel cells to generate heat. The heat output increases when built next to other reactors.\nPress __CONTROL__reactor-interface-toggle__ to toggle circuit interface.

[virtual-signal-name]
signal-temperature=Temperature
signal-fuel=Fuel remaining
signal-reactor-stop=Stop reactor

[virtual-signal-description]
signal-temperature=Reactor temperature
signal-fuel=Percentage of current fuel cell remaining in reactor
signal-reactor-stop=Send this signal to a reactor interface to stop the reactor

[mod-setting-name]
reactor-interface-merged=Merged interface sprite
reactor-interface-auto-build=Automatically build interfaces
reactor-interface-tick-interval=Update interval

[mod-setting-description]
reactor-interface-merged=Disable this option if experiencing graphical issues with modded reactors
reactor-interface-auto-build=Automatically add an interface when a new reactor is built
reactor-interface-tick-interval=Tick delay between reactor interface updates

[controls]
reactor-interface-toggle=Add/remove reactor interface
