[mod-setting-description]
dynamic-construction-queue-max-response-time=The construction queue update rate is continously adjusted so that each ghost is checked at least once in the time set here.
dynamic-construction-queue-track-tiles=If unchecked, tile ghosts like concrete and landfill are ignored. Tiles have their own construction queue, so if you don't care about speedy tile construction you can uncheck this without affecting response time for normal entities.
