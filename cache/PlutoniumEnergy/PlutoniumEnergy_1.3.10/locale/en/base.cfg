plutonium-nuclear-power=Plutonium nuclear power
MOX-fuel-reprocessing=MOX fuel reprocessing
plutonium-ammo=Plutonium ammo
plutonium-atomic-bomb=Plutonium atomic bomb
plutonium-enrichment-process=Plutonium enrichment process

[technology-description]
plutonium-processing=Processing of plutonium, radioactive element that don't exist in nature but can be created in nuclear reactor.
plutonium-nuclear-power=Gives much more energy than uranium, but 2 times slower.
MOX-fuel-reprocessing=The process of reprocessing used MOX fuel to get additional plutonium.
plutonium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from plutonium for higher damage.
plutonium-atomic-bomb=Atomic bomb made with plutonium instead of uranium. Explosion power is higher by nearly 40%.
plutonium-enrichment-process=The process of creating high-energy isotopes from low-energy isotopes. Requires a lot of high-energy isotopes as catalyst and takes more time than Kovarex enrichment process.

[mod-setting-name]
PE-disable-MOX-reactor=Disable MOX reactor recipe
PE-disable-U238-excess-neutron-capture-recipe=Disable Uranium-238 excess neutron capture recipe
PE-SUP-advanced-nfr-uranium-concentrate=Use Uranium concentrate as product of advanced nuclear fuel reprocessing
enable-plutonium-ammo=Enable plutonium ammo

[mod-setting-description]
PE-disable-MOX-reactor=Disables MOX reactor for compatibility with some mods.
PE-disable-U238-excess-neutron-capture-recipe=Disable Uranium-238 excess neutron capture recipe. Some players want this recipe disabled for balancing reasons.
PE-SUP-advanced-nfr-uranium-concentrate=When turned on and SchallUraniumProcessing mod is installed, advanced nuclear fuel reprocessing recipe will have Uranium concentrate as a product instead of uranium-238 (Depleted uranium in SchallUraniumProcessing).
enable-plutonium-ammo=Enable or disable plutonium rounds magazine and cannon shells.

[mod-description]
PlutoniumEnergy=Adds processing of plutonium, an excess product from nuclear reaction. Plutonium can be used to make ammo (even plutonium atomic bomb) and to generate power as MOX fuel.
