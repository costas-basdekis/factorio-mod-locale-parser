This makes normal underground water available on super-dry desert maps.\n  - Water remineralisation: Distilleries and chemical plants are able to convert pure water back into water through water remineralisation.\n  - Water remineralisation with stone: Stone is an additional ingredient required for water remineralisation. Only chemical plants are able to run this process."}
