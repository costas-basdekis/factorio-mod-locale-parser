[technology-description]
air-defiltering=Enables the crafting of Air deFilter Machines to FUCk air quality by adding pollution
air-defiltering-mk2=Improved versions of the Air deFilter Machines can defilter the air better. Has increased power and air defilter consumption.
air-defiltering-mk3=The fastest alternative for fucking up the air but at the cost of a high amount of power. It also uses air defilters much more quickly.
air-defilter-recycling=Used air defilters can be reused after being recycled by using a bit of coal to refill them.
