[mod-setting-name]
accumulator-wagon-update-inactivity-conditions=Update Inactivity Conditions

[mod-setting-description]
accumulator-wagon-update-inactivity-conditions=By default, changes in accumulator level don't count as 'activity' for train conditions. This allows these conditions to function, but has the side-effect of causing trains to immediately leave stations that become disabled by circuit conditions
