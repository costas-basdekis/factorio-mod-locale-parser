[mod-setting-description]
rainbow-player-color-enable= Turn this on if you would like this mod to do anything.
rainbow-player-color-change-time= Player color gradually changes from red, to yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and back to red. This setting controls how many seconds it takes to go from one color to the next. Six times this value is how long it takes to return to the starting color.
rainbow-player-color-alpha= The player color's "alpha", a value from 0 to 1. This does *not* behave like normal alpha and the Factorio devs describe it as "black magic". 0 looks very washed out while 1 gives a deep color that I like, with 0.5 being the "correct" value of alpha.
