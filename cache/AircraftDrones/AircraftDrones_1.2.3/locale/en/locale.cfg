show-messages=Show info messages
destination-coordinates-modifier=Destination coordinates modifier (in percent)
use-classic-targeter=Use classic targeter remote
airstrike-range=Drone range (in tiles)

[mod-setting-description]
show-messages=Show messages for certain events (mission starts, flare burnout, ...)
destination-coordinates-modifier=Occasionally drones might not be able to reach the coordiates of their current destination. They will circle above it forever. Change this setting to avoid that: below 100 percent the destination check will be more strict, resulting in a nicer flight path and more drones occasionally beeing stuck. Above 100 percent less drones get stuck, but the flight path might get ugly (i.e. drones not landing directly on the runway). 
use-classic-targeter=Switches from the artillery-remote-like targeter to the classic targeter. The classic targeter needs a long reach mod, but has no artillery interference issues (see mod page for details)
airstrike-range=Drone range for bombing missions
