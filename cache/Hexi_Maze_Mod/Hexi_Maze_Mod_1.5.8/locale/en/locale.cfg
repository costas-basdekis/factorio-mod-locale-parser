[mod-setting-description]
maze-width=The width of each individual maze, in cells. This does not include the one cell wide passages between mazes.
maze-height=The height of each individual maze, in cells. This does not include the one cell wide passages between mazes.
maze-tile-size=The size of each cell of a maze, in tiles. This includes the thickness of cell walls.
maze-border-size=The thickness of cell walls, in tiles.
ore-scale=The multiplier for non-spawn ore field richness.
ore-scale-spawn=The multiplier for spawn ore field richness.
spawn-cutout=The size of the open area you spawn in, in cells. Note that this is a distance in all four directions.
ore-grass=When enabled, all ores will create grass beneath them to ensure they successfully spawn.
ore-grass-spawn=When enabled, start area ores will create grass. Does nothing if the above setting is enabled.
ore-flat=When enabled, all ore tiles in an ore node will have roughly the same amount of ore.
block-crossroad=When enabled, maze exterior passage crossing points will be blocked off. This forces going through mazes to travel long distances.
start-ore-names=The internal IDs of the four starting ore patches, in clockwise order starting with north. Incorrect IDs are silently ignored.
start-ore-names-2=The internal IDs of the four extra starting ore patches, in clockwise order starting with north. Incorrect IDs are silently ignored.
correct-size=When enabled, ore field sizes and counts will be tweaked to more closely match their intended distribution. When disabled, only ore field counts will change.
disable-water=When enabled, all water on the map is removed.
biter-passage=When enabled, biters can walk over maze walls as if they were regular land.


disable-radar=When enabled, radars cannot be placed. They can still be crafted, so that satellites can be made. Already placed radars will remain placed and will be unmineable, but will continue to function.
reduce-radar=When enabled, radars will not scan new sectors. They can still be used to reveal the map around themselves.
disable-logistics-chests=When enabled, the logistics research will not unlock Active Provider and Requester chests.
