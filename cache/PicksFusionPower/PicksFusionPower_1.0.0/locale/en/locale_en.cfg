[item-description]
pi-heavy-water-pellet=From a chemical view heavy water is water with the formula D2O. From normal water, in this circumstates also called light water, it differs thereby that the normal hydrogen atoms are replaced by heavy hydrogen atoms from the isotope Deuterium (D).
pi-deuterium-pellet=Deuterium (D , also known as heavy hydrogen) is a natural isotope of hydrogen . The nucleus of a deuterium atom, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron.
pi-tritium-pellet=Tritium (symbol T) is a rare and radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons.  \n It can be produced by irradiating lithium metal or lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles in a nuclear reactor.
