[item-description]
roboport=The roboport is the core of any logistic robot network. Any contiguous block of roboports, logistic chests, and logistic connectors forms a network.
logistic-connector=Allows roboports to connect to non-adjacent chests. A line of chests will do the job, but these are cheaper and have less passive power drain.
construction-beacon=Improved logistic connector with a large construction area.

pb-battery-rebalance=Logistic robot battery rebalance
pb-roboport-radius=6x6 logistic range

[mod-setting-description]
pb-battery-rebalance=Increases the recharge speed of roboports but reduces battery size of logistic bots. Makes bots less suited for long range operation while increasing the number of bots supportable by a single roboport. Increases bot speed slightly to compensate for more frequent recharge trips.
pb-roboport-radius=Increases the logistic area of roboports to 6x6. Makes the restrictions on bots slightly more flexible, notably by allowing logistic networks to bridge a railroad.
