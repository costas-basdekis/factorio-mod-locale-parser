{"name": "freenetworkwiring", "version": "1.0.4", "title": "Free Network Wiring", "author": "Vas", "homepage": "https://mods.factorio.com/mod/freenetworkwiring", "description": "With the circuit network already being annoying as is, no one wants to have to pay for thousands of wires! Not to mention, blueprints give you the wires for free, so this mod makes the red and green wires free, and is compatible with nearly any mod that alters those wires.  I'll add compatibility to other modded wires too if someone ever makes any other color wires.", "factorio_version": "1.1"}
