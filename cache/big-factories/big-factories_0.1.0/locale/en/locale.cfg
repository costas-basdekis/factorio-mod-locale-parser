[item-description]
bf-big-building=Base building for housing big factories

[mod-setting-name]
bf-centrifuge-in-assembler=Centrifuge recipes
bf-craftable=Enable crafting recipes
bf-indestructible=Spawned factories indestructible
bf-loaders=Generate loaders
bf-minable=Allow factories to be mined
bf-module-slots=Big factory module slots
bf-scale-icon=Scale icons
bf-size-factor=Size factor
bf-spawn=Spawn big factories
bf-spawn-chance=Spawn chance
bf-speed-factor=Speed factor
bf-suppress-loaders=Suppress loaders on fluid box positions

[mod-setting-description]
bf-centrifuge-in-assembler=Adds the centrifuge recipes to the big assembling machine. There is no big building for the centrifuge itself, because the image scaling doesn't work for it, for some reason.
bf-craftable=Enable the technology and recipes to craft new big factories. If the mining setting is disabled, they cannot be moved once placed.
bf-indestructible=Makes spawned factories indestructible, so they don't get killed by biters before you can get to them. Manually built or moved factories will not be indestructible.
bf-loaders=Spawn loaders on all sides of big factories. Loaders can be filtered, rotated and manually removed.
bf-minable=Allow mining and re-placing existing big factories
bf-module-slots=Amount of module slots for big factories. Set to -1 to keep the original entity's module slots.
bf-scale-icon=Scale the recipe icons on factories up, relative to factory size
bf-size-factor=Determines how big the big factories are compared to their base. Also increases health.
bf-spawn=Spawn free big factories across the map
bf-spawn-chance=Chance that a chunk will have a big factory
bf-speed-factor=Determines how fast the big factories are compared to their base. Also increases energy requirement. Note that the base game forces a one tick minimum for recipe crafting time, so there's a hard coded maximum of 60 crafts per second.
bf-suppress-loaders=Makes sure the fluid boxes are easily accessible on all sides, by not spawning loaders in front of them

[shortcut-name]
bf-loader-tool=Big Factories loader tool

[technology-name]
bf-construction=Big factory construction

[technology-description]
bf-construction=Allows construction of new big factory buildings
