[entity-name]
microwave-tower=Microwave Tower
microwave-tower-interface=Microwave Tower

[entity-description]
microwave-tower=Distributes power to microwave rectenna equipment in range. Each tower can charge a single target at a time, and each target can only be charged by a single tower at a time.
microwave-tower-interface=Distributes power to microwave rectenna equipment in range. Each tower can charge a single target at a time, and each target can only be charged by a single tower at a time.

[mod-setting-name]
mw-show-debug=Show Debug Messages
mw-exp-drain=Experimental: Drain not Discharge
mw-charge-radius=Microwave Tower Range
mw-charge-interval=Microwave Tower Charge Interval
mw-search-interval=Microwave Tower Search Interval

[mod-setting-description]
mw-show-debug=Shows diagnostic messages during runtime.
mw-exp-drain=When true, adjusts interface's drain rate instead of directly depleting the energy buffer.
mw-charge-radius=Maximum charge distance from a tower in tiles. Every tower must search their radius every search interval, so higher values may cause performance issues.
mw-charge-interval=Towers provide power to existing targets every -interval- ticks. Increase this if you are having performance issues.
mw-search-interval=Towers without targets will search for them every -interval- ticks, lowering this may cause performance issues.
