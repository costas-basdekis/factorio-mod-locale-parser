virtual-planet-width=The "virtual" width of the world.
ticks-per-update=Number of ticks between each tile is revealed
amplitude-multiplier=Increase or decrease the height of the waveform that determines what part of the map is revealed.
frequency-multiplier=Increase or decrease the width (or frequency) of the wave form in which the map is revealed.

[mod-setting-description]
virtual-planet-width=The width of the map that will be exposed as the virtual planet.  This value is in tiles to the right of the rockets launch site.  So the "virtual" planet is twice this value.  For example, a value of 10,000 will result in a "virtual" planet 20,000 tiles across, 10,000 to the left of the rocket silo and 10,000 to the right.
ticks-per-update=The amount of time it takes for the next tile to be revealed.  This number is in ticks, the larger the number the longer the wait till the next tile is shown and the slower the map is revealed.
amplitude-multiplier=The map is revealed in a wave form much like a satellites actual track on a map of the world.  This multiplier affects the height of that wave.  A larger value will increase the region above and below the rocket launch site that will be revealed.  A large value will also result in slower mapping as there is more territory to reveal.
frequency-multiplier=Similar to the amplitude multiplier, a larger value here will cause the wave form to be spread out (left-to-right) and will complete a full mapping of the "virtual" planet in less time than a smaller number.
