wisp-yellow=Yellow will-o'-the-wisps live in forests and do not attack first. 
wisp-red=Red will-o'-the-wisps live under stones. Physical damage leads to fast replication process.
wisp-purple=Will-o'-the-wisp in the state of spore. They cause the corrosion of structures around and have a devastating effect on solar power plants.
UV-lamp=UV-light is the only solution to reduce a lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night. Also affects on other types of the wisps. (Range: 10 tiles)
wisp-detector=The breakthrough in the alien biotechnology made it possible to detect the wisps at a location nearby. (Default range: 16 tiles)
