[technology-description]
more-advanced-oil-processing = Using the Carbon rich coal and some electrolyzed water for the Hydrogen you can make a more potend type of oil. coal enriched oil
super-thermal-conducter = Using some oils extracted from wood and oil. You have made it possible to heat this new fluid "super conducter" to a maximum temperature of 500 degrees befor reaching critical temprature, the new super conducter you made can store a lot more energie then your standart water.
basic-oil-from-wood = Upon taking a look at how Natual oil is made, you discovered that oil is basicly organic material compressed over a long period of time. But you need the oil now so you have found a way to make oil using wood and just a bit of time. It is verry wastfull.
advanced-oil-from-wood = You have refined the way to make oil from your wood, now it take's less wood and time. but still giving you just as much oil.
oil-drill = Afther you carfully dropped a probe on accedent in an oil well you found out that the oil is everywhere if you just dig deep enough. This has given yu he idea to make a drill that can suck up oil from the deep bubbels everywhere around you. Did I mention it usesses a LOT of power and is not exactly "clean"
better-deep-oil-drilling = After analyzing the data you colleced from the first couple of diggs you did with your drill. You are able to optimize the program for locating and extracting he oil.
mastered-deep-oil-drilling = You have further improved the locating and extracting programs. But with the current drilling machine you have hit the limit of its technical capabilities.
alien-artifact-from-oil = Afther nearly being killed by an elite biter squad in your quest for alien artifacts, you came upon the great idea of having some pets... when that plan did not go as planned. You turned to oil and found smal traces of alien DNA. And an eternity later you had biter eggs wich you carefully extracted artifacts from. And so oil solved one more of your endless problems
