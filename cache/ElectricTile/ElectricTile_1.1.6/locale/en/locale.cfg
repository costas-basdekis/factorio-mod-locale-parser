[mod-description]
ElectricTile=The mod adds a coverage over which electricity and signals can be transmitted \n Place the monitor on the coverage to read and transmit signals \n Signals are transmitted to the coverage when the red or green wire is connected to the monitor \n If there is a signal on the coating, the monitor will automatically read them when connected \n Separate sections of the circuit with monitors so that signals do not mix
